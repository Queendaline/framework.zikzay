These factors can nutrition, pollution, altitude, temperatures, and exposure to sunlight. For example, if a child has a potential to grow six feet tall, but is malnourished, there is a chance that he might never reach that height. Or two parents have dark skin and move to an area that is very sunny most of the year, their children may have lighter-coloured skin than they. Therefore, heredity and environment make up the gene traits.</p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h3>Unit 3</h3><h3>Meaning of Dominant and Recessive Traits.</h3><h3>Mendel&rsquo;s Experiments</h3><p>Gregor Mendel carried out several experiments on pea plant. In one such experiments, he chose a pure-breeding tall pea plant and crossed it with dwarf plant. He did this by taking pollen from one plant and dusting it on the stigma of the other. He took precaution and made sure was not contaminated with its own pollen or that of any other plant. Fertilization took place resulting to seed formation. The seeds resulting from this cross were collected and sown. It was found out that all the seeds gave birth to tall plants, no dwarf plant was produced at all. These plants belong to what he called the first filial generation (or F1 for short).</p><p>Furthermore, one these tall F1 was then self-pollinated, took precautions and made sure that it was not pollinated by any other kind of pollen. The resulting seeds were sown and offspring (belonging to second filial generation (F2 for short) were carefully examined. Mendel found that the F2 plants were a mixture of tall and short pea plants. In one particular cross, he observed that the proportion of tall to dwarf plants approximates to a ratio of 3:1.</p><h4>Conclusion from Mendel&rsquo;s Experiment</h4><p>No medium- sized plants were formed from neither then F1 nor F2 generations. Hence, inheritance is not a process in which the features of the two parents are balanced together to produce an intermediate result. Rather it is process in which definite structures or particles (genes) which may or may not show themselves in outward appearance of the organisms, are transmitted from parents to offspring.</p><p>Secondly, no dwarf plants were formed in the F1 generation despite the fact that one of the parents was dwarf. This shows that, as the factor for dwarfness fails to show in the F1 generation, it must in some way be swamped by the factor for tallness. This means that the gene for tallness is dominant to the gene for dwarfness, and the latter said to recessive.</p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h3>Unit 4</h3><h3>Genes and their Pattern of Transmission</h3><h3>Phenotype and genotype</h3><p>The pattern of gene transmission from one generation to another can be illustrated using a genetic diagram. This is as follows: The gene for tallness is represented by T, and the gene for dwarfness by t. Each contains a pair of identical genes. TT in the case of a tall plant, tt in the case of dwarf plant. When organisms (plant or animal) contain identical genes like this, it is said to be homozygotous.&nbsp; The genetical constitution of an organism is known as its genotype.

(5, 2, 'Chapter 2', 'Environmental Hazard1', '<h2>Topic 2</h2><h3>Environmental Hazards 1</h3><h3>Sub Topic: Environmental Hazard1</h3><h3>2.1. Introduction</h3><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We recall that the environment is the total circumstances surrounding an organism or group of organisms, specifically.</p><ol><li>The combination of extemal physical conditions that affect and influence the growth and development of organisms.</li><li>The complex of social and cultural conditions affecting the nature of an individual or community. Therefore, an environmental hazard is any condition, process state adversely affecting the environment. Environmental hazards are those things which expose the environment to danger, harm or risks.</li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Hazards manifest as physical or chemical pollution in air, water and soils. Environmental hazards can cause wide spread ham to humans and the physical environment. This Theme discusses soil erosion.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h4>Unit 1</h4><h4>Meaning of Soil Erosion</h4><p>Soil erosion is defined as the wearing a way of top soil. Top soil is the top layer of soil and it is the most fertile because it contains the most organic nutrient rich materials. Therefore, this is the layer that farmers want to protect for growing their crops and constructing ranches growing grasses for their cattle to graze on.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h4>Unit 2</h4><h4>&nbsp;Factors Determining Soil Erosion</h4><p>There are various factors determining soil erodibility. The following are the most important ones:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><ol><li><strong>Slope of the land (topography):</strong> The steeper the slope, the greater the erosion as a result of the increased velocity (swiftness) of water flow.</li><li><strong>Soil texture (type of soil):</strong> Soil texture is the &lsquo;size distribution of soil particles. The size particles never change.</li><li><strong>Soil Structure:</strong> Soil structure means the grouping or arrangement of soil particles. Over cultivation and compaction cause the soil to lose the structure and cohesion (ability to stick together) and it erodes more easily.</li><li><strong>Organic Materials:</strong> Organic material is the &ldquo;glue&rdquo; that binds the soil particles together and plays an important role preventing soil erosion. Organic matter is main source of energy for soil organisms both plants and animals. It also influences the infiltrating capacity of the soil thereby, reducing runoff.</li><li><strong>Vegetative cover:</strong> The loss of protective covering through overgrazing, ploughing and fire (activities of man) makes soil vulnerable to being swept away by wind and water.</li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><h5>Types of Water Erosion and Surface Water Runoff</h5><p>One of the main causes of soil erosion is water erosion; which is the loss of topsoil due to water. Raindrops fall directly on topsoil. The impact of the raindrops loosens the material bonding it together, allowing small fragments to detach. If the rainfall continues, water gathers on the ground causing water flow on the lang surface, known as &ldquo;surface water runoff&rsquo;. This runoff carries the detached soil materials away deposits them elsewhere. The materials may be washed down slope of the land and either end up the value or are washed away out to sea by streams and rivers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h5>Forms of water Erosion</h5><ol><li><strong>Sheet Erosion</strong>: Sheet erosion is erosion that occurs fairly evenly over an area. As raindrops loosen the soil the Surface water runoff can transport top soil in a uniform fashion, almost uke a bed sheet sliding off of a bed. This can be so subtle that it might not even be noticed until much of the valuable nutrient-rich topsoil has already been washed away.</li><li><strong>Rill Erosion</strong>: Rill erosion is erosion that results in small, short-lived and well-defined streams. When rainfall does not soak into the soil, it can gather on the surface and runs downhill, forming narrow tracks or small channels of water known as rills through which the water flows carrying soil nutrients along with.</li><li><strong>Gully Erosion</strong>: Gully erosion can be thought of as advanced ill erosion. In fact, if rills are not addressed or checked, they will grow into larger gullies. Therefore, gully erosion occurs when rainfall causes continuous removal of soil particles along a particular course that it results in the cutting of-a narrow ditch. This ditch gradually deepens and widens as water continues to flow along it until gullies are formed.</li><li><strong>Bank </strong><strong>Erosion (Stream Bank Erosion): </strong>Bank erosion is another type of water erosion. Bank erosion is defined as the erosion of the bank of a stream or water ways.</li><li><strong>Wind Erosion:</strong> Of course, water is not only the agent that can cause erosion.</li></ol><p>Wind Erosion Definition: Wind erosion is simply the loss of topsoil due to wind.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h4>Unit 3</h4><h4>Cause of wind erosion:</h4><p>&nbsp;The following are causes of soil erosion.</p><ul><li>Water</li><li>Wind</li><li>Glacier (ice)</li><li></li></ul><h5>Effects of Soil Erosion</h5><p>The following effects may ensue as a result of soil erosion.</p><ul><li>Top soil which is rich in organic matter, fertility and soil life relocated to somewhere else.</li><li>It reduces land productivity, resulting in poor plant yield.</li><li>It may lead to famine in the land and in extreme hunger.</li><li>It contributes to pollution of adjacent water.</li><li>Crop emergence, growth and yield are directly affected by the loss of natural nutrient and applied fertilizer and pesticides.</li><li>Seeds and plants can be easily disturbed or completely removed or buried.</li>\r\n<li>Soil stability, quality and texture can be affected by the loss of soil.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h4>Unit 5</h4>\r\n<h4>Control /Prevention of Soil Erosions</h4>\r\n<p>There are two major methods of controlling/preventing erosion. Which includes:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Cultural and method.</li>\r\n<li>Construction of barriers.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>These are further discussed in details:</p>\r\n<h5>Cultural Methods of Controlling Erosions</h5>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Cropping and Vegetation</strong>: The Potential for erosion increases if the soil has little or no vegetation cover of plant and or crop residues. Vegetative cover is the covering of piece-of land or soil with vegetation to prevent the direct exposure of the topsoil to water runoffs and wind.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Planting Cover crops like melon and potatoes</strong>. There, are Some crops that provide a bulk Protective cover for a major Portion of the year such as alfalfa or winter cover crop.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Grass</strong> This means allowing the soil to rest under the grass for some time before cultivating it.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Crop rotation which involves planting different </strong>crop on the same piece of land at different times.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ol start=\"2\">\r\n<li>2<strong>. Application of Compost.</strong> The use of human or animal droppings tend to raise the organic matter content of the soil. Organic miter makes soil easy for water absorption, binds the soil particles together and reduces the rate of runoff.</li>\r\n<li><strong> Avoidance of Bush Burning. </strong>Stop setting the bush on fire This is because fire destroys the ground cover which protects the soil against erosion. It also destroys organic matter, soil organisms and flora which aerate and enrich the soil.</li>\r\n<li>4<strong>. Stop Over-Grazing</strong>: Over grazing expose the topsoil to erosion, and the feet of herdsmen animals harden the top layer of the soil, making it impossible for water permeate into the soil.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Application Fertilizer/Liming the Soil</strong> (inorganic matter): This adds lime to the soil, which binds the soil particles together, form, good crumb structure is difficult to be eroded away.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h5>The Importance of Plants in Checking Soil Erosion</h5>\r\n<p>As a matter of emphasis, we must try to exploit all our cultural methods of checking erosion especially by using plants for the following reasons.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Plants slow down water as to flow over the land (runoff) and allows much of the rain to soak the soil.</li>\r\n<li>Plant roots hold the soil in position and prevent it from being washed away.</li>\r\n<li>Plants break the impact of a raindrop before it hits the soil thus reducing its ability to erode.</li>\r\n<li>Plants in wetlands and on the banks of fivers are of particular importance as they stow down the flow of the water and their roots bind the soil, thus preventing erosion.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h5>Controlling Soil Erosion by Constructions.</h5>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong> Construction of Barriers:</strong> construct rocks or blocks as intervening structure across erosion pathway especially in the case of gully erosion. This will reduce the speed of the runoffs and fill the gully with sand and residual matters.</li>\r\n<li><strong> Planting Trees</strong>: Tall trees can be planted especially in sandy areas as wind breaks. This will reduce the rate of wind erosion. Furthermore, it may be stated here that crop management system that favours contour ploughing, Strip-cropping and terracing techniques can further reduce the amount of erosion in an erosion prone zone.</li>\r\n<li><strong> Terracing: </strong>This involves leveling a hilly area in form of steps so that planting is done on the horizontal portion while the vertical portion acts as a retaining wall. Terracing reduces the speed of water.</li>\r\n<li><strong>construction of contour Bunds: </strong>This is the construction of ridge (also known bunds) across a slope horizontally: These as wash-stops preventing run-offs down the slopes. Water then settles on the ground and deposits suspended residual matters. This makes the runoffs be diverted to other directions along the contour and thereby slowing down the speed of flow.</li>\r\n<li><strong> strip-cropping: </strong>This involves leaving some strips&rdquo; of land uncultivated between cultivated areas. This reduces the rate of runoffs. Often times, tall grasses may be planted along the contour lines to form barrier Strips. This becomes very encouraging in areas where the slope of land is not steep.</li>\r\n<li><strong> Making-Sit Traps:</strong> Stil-traps are made from stakes and woven with bamboo spits These are driven into channels of guilty erosion to control the downward movement of water run-offs.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>In summary, preventing so erosion can be very involving as it has political, economic and technical implications.</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<h4>Unit 6</h4>\r\n<h4>Sub-Topic: Flooding Meaning of Flooding</h4>\r\n<p>Flooding is a weather-related environmental hazard that is widespread around the world. It can occur virtually anywhere. A flood defined as water overflowing onto land that is usually dry. Flooding often thought of as a result of heavy rainfall. However, floods can arise in a number of ways that are not directly related to ongoing weather events Floods can cause disasters to homes farmers, industries, Communities and creating untold hardships for them. For instance, it has forced many people to leave their natural lands and homes and relocate to other places.</p>\r\n<p>In this Unit, we shall learn about drainage patterns, meanings, cause and effects of flood including prevention measures.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h5>&nbsp;Drainage patters</h5>\r\n<p><strong>Definition:</strong></p>\r\n<p>Drainage is the natural or artificial removal of surface and sub-surface water from an area. Many agricultural soils need drainage to improve production or to ensure water supplies. Alliteratively, drainage can also be defined as a system by which water or waste flows away. Drainage systems are the patterns formed by the streams, rivers and lakes in a particular drainage basin. According to the shape of the channels, drainage s&rsquo; stems can Bil into one of several categories known&rdquo; as drainage patterns. Drainage patterns depend on the topography and geology of the natural or man-made (artificial). Natural Drainage Patterns</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>Accord to Drainage Pattern</strong>. A drainage system is described as accordant if its pattern correlates to the structure and relief of the landscape over which it flows.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Dendritic Drainage Pattern: </strong>Dendritic: systems are the most common form of drainage system. In this type, many contributing steams join together and flow into the tributaries of the main river near a sloppy area or at oblique angle. It works like a tree with its branches.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>Dendritic systems form in V-shaped valleys hence the surface rocks must be impervious and non-porous (does not allow water to seep down).</p>\r\n<ol start=\"3\">\r\n<li><strong>Parallel Drainage pattern: </strong>Parallel drainage system is a pattern of rivers, caused by steep slopes with same relief. The steep slopes cause the streams to flow swiftly and in a straight line with few tributaries and all low in the same direction. This system forms a uniformity slopping surface. For instance, rivers flowing Fast West or South West uniformly in &lsquo; straight line. Other examples are rivers flowing south east from the Aberdare mountains in Kenya.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ol start=\"4\">\r\n<li><strong>Trellis Drainage Pattern</strong>: The geometry of a trellis drainage system is similar to that of a common garden trellis used to grow vines. As the river flows along a strike valley, smaller tributaries feed into it from the steep slopes on the sides of mountains. These tributaries enter the main river at approximately 90&deg; angle, causing a trellis-like appearance of the drainage system. Trellis drainage is characteristic of folded mountains such as the Appalachian Mountains in North America and in the North part of Trinidad.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ol start=\"5\">\r\n<li><strong>Rectangular Drainage pattern: </strong>Rectangular drainage system develops on rocks that are of union, resistance to erosion, but which have two directions of joining at approximately right angles. The joints are usually less resistant to erosion than the bulk rock; so, erosion tends to preferentially open-the joints and streams eventually develop along the joints. This results in a stream system in which streams consisting mainly of straight-line segments with right angles bends and tributaries join larger streams at right angles.&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ol start=\"2\">\r\n<li><strong>Radial drainage pattern: </strong>In radial drainage system, the streams radiate outward from a central high point. Volcanoes usually display excellent radial drainage pattern.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ol start=\"3\">\r\n<li><strong>Deranged drainage pattern: </strong>This is a drainage system in drainage basins where there is no coherent pattern to the rivers and lakes. It happens in areas where there has been much geological disruptions. A good example is the Canadian shield.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ol start=\"4\">\r\n<li><strong>Annular Drainage pattern/Reticulate Pattern:</strong> In an annular drainage pattern, steams follow a roughly circular concentrated path along a belt of weak rock in a ring like pattern.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h4>Unit 7</h4>\r\n<h4>Man-Made or Artificial Drainage System</h4>\r\n<p>Man-made drainage systems depend a number of factors. These factors include topography (structure), climate and vegetation cover of the level. Artificial drainage system could be divided into two:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Surface drainage system</li>\r\n<li>Underground drainage system.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<h5>Meaning of Flood and Flooding</h5>\r\n<p>Floods generally develop over a Period of time when there is too much rainfall to fit in the rivers, streams, Oceans, seas, dans, gutter or drainages and consequently water spreads over the land including farmlands, market places as well as buildings. This results in loss of lives and property. This is known as flood. Therefore, flood is defined as an over-flow of much volume of water which covers the land. Flooding, itself is a phenomenon in which an area of land temporarily submerged by. Could last for some days or weeks before the flood dries or recedes.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h4>Unit 8</h4>\r\n<h4>Types of flood</h4>\r\n<p>There are three common types of flood. These are:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>Coastal (Surge flood)</strong>: Coastal flood as the name suggests occurs in areas that lie in the coast of Sea, Ocean, or other large bodies open water. It is typically the result of extreme tidal conditions caused by Severe weather, such as hurricanes and other storms.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Fluvial (River flood)</strong>: Fluvial or riverine flooding occurs when excessive rainfall over an extended period of time cause a river to exceed its capacity. It can also be caused by heavy snow melt and ice jams. The damage from a river flood can be widespread as the overflow affects smaller downstream often causing dams and dikes to break and swamp nearby areas.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Fluvial (Surface flood):</strong> A fluvial or surface flood is caused when heavy rainfall creates a flood event independent of an over flowing water</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h4>Unit 9</h4>\r\n<h4>Causes of flood&nbsp;</h4>\r\n<p>Flooding occurs most commonly from heavy rainfall when natural watercourses do not have capacity to convey excess water. But note that the floods are not always caused by: heavy rainfall. They can result from other phenomenon particularly coastal areas, such as storm surge associated with a tropical cyclone, a tsunami or a high tide. Sometimes, earthquake could cause dams to break which may result in flooding of the downstream areas. Other factors which may contribute to flooding include;</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Volume, Spatial distribution, intensity and duration of rainfall) over a catchment capacity of the watercourse or stream network to convey runoff.</li>\r\n<li>Catchment and weather conditions prior to a rainfall event.</li>\r\n<li>Ground cover.</li>\r\n<li></li>\r\n<li>Tidal influences</li>\r\n<li>Blockage of drainage system can result to an over-flow of water after a heavy rainfall.</li>\r\n<li>Poor outlay of the city without good drainage system by urban planners.</li>\r\n<li>When streams, rivers and dams are filled to the brim, any additional rainfall will cause the bank to overflow and flooding occurs. Prolonged drought can cause flooding due to sudden heavy rainfall after several years; producing torrential down pour which results in loss of lives and property.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<h4>Unit 10</h4>\r\n<h4>Community and Farmland</h4>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Floodwater can seriously disrupt public and personal transport by cutting off roads and railway lines, as well as communication links when telephone lines are damaged.</li>\r\n<li>Floods disrupt normal drainage systems in cities, and sewage spill are usually very common which portend a serious health hazard. Bacteria, mould, viruses and pathogens (diseases causing microorganism) cause &ndash; diseases which trigger allergic reactions and continue to damage materials long after a flood.</li>\r\n<li>Adults, children and livestock may get drowned in the flood.</li>\r\n<li>Flood can contaminate natural water supplies, leading to scarcity of drinking water. This happens when floods flow into streams used for drinking.</li>\r\n<li>Agricultural produce may be lost due to flood resulting in to food shortage and high cost of living.</li>\r\n<li>Some plants that cannot tolerate too much water environment may be choked up and die.</li>\r\n<li>Trees may be pulled down and this will lead to deforestation.</li>\r\n<li>Economic hardship may ensue due homes/businesses and Cost of rebuilding damaged and personal property, but the water Submerged property, dearth of food behind causes further damage and high cost of living, books, furniture, photographs and electronic equipment damaged and so on.</li>\r\n<li>People may be displaced from their release of toxic materials from homes and offices and this may force the displaced people to in open fields in schools as refugees where the government can come to their aid through food supplies, clothing and sleeping materials. In 2013, we had the case of internally displaced people (IDP).</li>\r\n<li>Flood can distribute large amounts of water sediments over vast areas, restocking valuables nutrients to agricultural land.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<h4>Unit 11</h4>\r\n<h4>&nbsp;Prevention of Flooding</h4>\r\n<p>Meteorologists and environmental agencies aim at protecting people and their property from flooding, helping organizations like the police to give warnings of possible floods so that people can make arrangements or move out of the area if it is dangerous.</p>\r\n<p><strong>The flowing prevention measures could be made: </strong></p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Construction of levees along the riverbanks. A levee is a high-rise wall built to stop a fiver from overflowing its banks and causing flooding.</li>\r\n<li>Placing large rocks on riverbanks or gully and prevent erosion which may lead to serious flooding.</li>\r\n<li>By placing sand bags along riverbanks, gully, gutter drainage can serve as levee to check flooding.</li>\r\n<li>Wetlands should be protected. These are helpful in maintaining a natural drainage system as excess water may accumulate in them.</li>\r\n<li>By creating floodplains and winding streams whereby a special route for drainage of water is made. This prevents the accumulation of water and thereby controlling flooding.</li>\r\n<li>By adopting improved farming methods and afforestation; soil water permeation may be improved.</li>\r\n</ol>', 'JSS 1', 'Basic Science', '2021-10-12 15:14:21', '2021-10-12 15:16:43'),

Bush burning whether as a result of wildlife or a controlled bum affects not only the appearance of the landscape but also the quality of the soil in terms of organic matter content and vegetation biodiversity. The landscape may quickly recover after a fire with fresh new growth and emerging seedlings. Bush burning can further be described as the controlled or uncontrolled combustion of &lsquo;frees, shrubs, grasses and domesticated plants.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h4>Unit 2</h4>\r\n<h4>Practices that Influence Bush Burning</h4>\r\n<p>These practices may include social, economic and agricultural practices.</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>Farming</strong>: The practice of bush burning is deeply ingrained in the traditional farming system involving small-scale farmers who are probably lazy and do not have adequate funds to employ labourers or purchase tractors for land clearing.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Hunting Expedition</strong>: In mostaural of Nigeria especially in the Eastern, Northern and Western parts bush burning is used by hunters to hunt for animals during the dry season or harmattan time. Examples of some bush animals include, monkey, bush rabbit, snakes, gorillas, hyenas, Leopard and so on. These animals when caught are either eaten or sold to make money.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Deliberate Act</strong>. Sometimes people set mischievously. These people my not have any genuine reason for doing so. At times, it could be as a result of burning cigarette stub dropped by smokers.</li>\r\n<li>4<strong>. Malicious Act</strong>: Some people may willfully set other people&rsquo;s agricultural land on fire in order to Cause trouble which may eventually lead to fighting.</li>\r\n<li>5<strong>. Pests and Diseases Control</strong>: The Fulani herdsmen use bush burning as a method in checking pests and diseases in livestock management. Pests like ticks found on the bodies of the cattle or on the soil, rodents and snakes are either killed or driven away by the heat or smoke of the blaze.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<h4>Unit 3</h4>\r\n<h4>Effects of Bush burning</h4>\r\n<p>Bush burning has lot of impact on both the human and the environment. Consequences of uncontrolled bush burning are very obvious in areas characterized by torrential rainfall, strong wind and hot solar radiation. This is because even slight disturbance of the vegetal mantle may have very considerable impact on the organic content and vegetation biodiversity. The following are the economic consequences of bush burning.</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>The huge smoke and ashes soaring in the air during the heat result in pollution of the air and suffocation of people and other animals.</li>\r\n<li>Bush burning produces air pollutants such as carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons \"hydrogen sulphide, nitrogen oxides, sulphur oxides, ozone particulates and other oxidants all of which are detrimental to the environment and human health. These substances result from incomplete combustion of cellulose.</li>\r\n<li>Bush burning heats up the soil thereby destroying the nutrients resulting to poor crop yield which can lead to scarcity of food and famine.</li>\r\n<li>The huge smoke and Substances released into the air during the bush bushing can contribute to climate change. Climate change is one of the global Change disturbing the entire world; It affects water resources and agricultural systems.</li>\r\n<li>Bush burning results in green gasses emission leading to global warming. Some greenhouse gases include carbon dioxide, methane oxides of sulphur, oxides of nitrogen and chlorofluorocarbons etc. These substances deplete the ozone layer.</li>\r\n<li>disturbs the ecosystem since some microorganisms are killed.</li>\r\n<li>It leads to the destruction of economic trees, cash crops and animals that should have been allowed to grow.</li>\r\n<li>Bush burning has adverse impact on soil impaction.</li>\r\n<li>It increases the rate of flooding and soil erosion by making the soil structure and texture to be loose, porous and exposed. xi. It affects the soil pH (degree of acidity or alkalinity) by damaging</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h4>Unit 4</h4>\r\n<h4>Regulations against a Bush Burning</h4>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>There should be a serious National Action plan in terms of legislating laws against bush burning both at the state and LG/ levels. Defaulters must be forced to pay a certain amount of money as fine or as an alternative spend some time in prison as a deterrent.</li>\r\n<li>The policy of &ldquo;<strong>plant a tree today</strong>&rdquo; should be enforced in the school system. Tree planting stimulates afforestation and vegetation and prevents desert encouragement.</li>\r\n<li>Government should discourage people from indiscriminate felling of trees. Only duly certified accredited tree fellers should be allowed to cut down trees and replace.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p><strong>Deforestation 1</strong></p>\r\n<p>Deforestation is defined the clearance or clearing of forest or stands of trees where the land is thereafter converted to non-forest use.</p>\r\n<p>Examples converting forest lands to farms, ranches or urban use. Tropical rainforest is where the most concentrated deforestation activities occur.</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<h4>Units 5</h4>\r\n<h4>Reasons for Deforestation</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Trees are cut down to be sold as fuel (Sometimes in the o of charcoal) or timber (i.e. firewood)</li>\r\n<li>Cleared land may be used pasture for livestock and Cultivation of crops.</li>\r\n<li>Cleared land can also be used for plantation of commodities such as plantain trees, cocoa trees, Palm seedlings etc.</li>\r\n<li>More so, cleared land may be used for settlement like building of houses estates, churches, schools, industrial layout, roads markets or ranches etc.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h4>Unit 6</h4>\r\n<h4>Causes of Deforestation</h4>\r\n<p>According to the united nations framework of convention of climate change (UNFCC) secretariate, the main causes of deforestation include:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>Agriculture:</strong> This is the overwhelming direct cause of deforestation. Research findings show that subsistence farming is responsible for 48% of deforestation, commercial agricultural is responsible for 32% of deforestation, logging is responsible for 15% of deforestation and fuel wood removals make up 5% of deforestation.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Inequitable Distribution of Wealth and Power</strong>: This is one of the causes of deforestation since the poor peasant villagers are more likely to clear forest because they have no alternatives. Thus, they resort to felling down trees to be sold as firewood, charcoal, and timbers etc.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Urbanization and Over-Population</strong>: With increase in population growth, the government may decide to clear the forest for the construction of houses roads, industries, schools, churches and hospitals for use by the teeming population.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Business or Economic incentives:</strong> The high cost of living and also good items in the global market have led people to engage in forest conversion (making use of forest resources rather than forest conservation)</li>\r\n<li><strong>Corruption of Government Institution:</strong> Corrupt government officials could decide to enrich themselves by felling special trees in the states Ministry of Forest Resources and biodiversity conservation.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Cattle Ranching, Industries and Extensive \' Farming</strong>: &lsquo;The government may decide to engage in large-scale cattle ranching and extensive farming. These activities may lead to deforestation. For instance, bushes may be cleared to enable cattle graze.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Globalization:</strong> Globalization is often viewed as another root cause of deforestation. Forests may be Cleared to have space for the construction of aerodromes, super Class international markets, roads, Monasteries/convents etc. Such Structures can attract people from different parts of the world so that they can relate with others when they visit.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h4>Unit 7</h4>\r\n<h4>Effects of Deforestation on the Environment</h4>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Deforestation causes carbondioxide to Inger in the atmosphere</strong>. Usually plants use carbondioxide produced during respiration for photosynthesis. The absence of trees due _ to deforestation will make carbon (iv) to accumulate. As carbondioxide accumulates, it produces a layer in the atmosphere that traps radiation from the sun. The radiation is Converted to heat which causes global warming. This phenomenon is better described as Greenhouse effect.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Green Plants produce oxygen during the process photosynthesis</strong>. Therefore, trees are felled, this reduces amount of oxygen present in the atmosphere for respiration by plants and animals.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The decay and burning of plants and wood result in release of large amount carbon dioxide. The Carbon contributes greatly to warming. Since it is greenhouse</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gas (GHG).</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>In deforested areas, the land heats up faster and higher temperature, localized upward Motions enhance the formation of clouds and ultimately produce more rainfall.</li>\r\n<li>clearing of forests reduces soil cohesion, thereby resulting in soil erosion, flooding and landslides which frequently degrade into wasteland.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<h4>Unit 8</h4>\r\n<h4>&nbsp;</h4>\r\n<h4>Reforestation Project</h4>\r\n<p>In many parts of the world, especially in East Asian countries, reforestation, (planting young trees to replace felled for a more conducive habitat. frees) and afforestation (planting new trees) projects are increasing the area conservation and deforestation of forested land. In the People&rsquo;s Republic of China for instance, the government has launched a programme requiring every able-bodied citizen between the ages 11-60 years to plant 3-5 trees per year. The government claims that at least 1billion would have been planted every year in China since 1982 when it was first launched. March 12\" of every year in China is the planting holiday. This has introduced the Greenwall of China Projection which aims at halting the expansion of the Gobi Desert. China has also embarked on Aerially Delivered Reforestation and Erosion Control System and proposed Sahara Forest Project coupled with the Seawater Greenhouse. However, in Nigeria, we have National Environmental standard and Regulation Enforcement Agency (NESREA).</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>Farming:</strong> New farming methods are being developed to farm more intensively such as high-yield hybrid crops greenhouse autonomous building gardens and hydroponics. These methods are often dependent on chemical inputs to maintain necessary yields.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Forest Management:</strong> Effective forest management should be employed so that forest is protected and conserved not converted.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Bush Burning:</strong> There should be legislation against bush burning. It reduces the number of forests growing plants, biodiversity reduction and result in emission of dangerous gases. that enhance global warming.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Renewable Energy Sources:</strong> Alternative sources of fuel such the sun and wind (renewable sources) should be used addition, natural gas and kerosene can as well be used instead of firewood.</li>\r\n</ol>', 'JSS 1', 'Basic Science', '2021-10-12 15:23:47', '2021-10-12 15:23:47');

Desertification can also be defined as the degradation of land in arid, semi-arid and sub-humid dry areas, due to loss of vegetation, and soil moisture caused mainly by climatic changes and human activities.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;A desert is a large area of land that has very little water, very few plants growing on it and with large quantities of dry and hot sand dunes. The process of converting a useful land into a desert is desertification called desertification.</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<h4>Unit 2</h4>\r\n<h4>Geographical Spread of Deserts in the World</h4>\r\n<p>Deserts are widely spread in the world.</p>\r\n<p>Some of them are:</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>Sahara Desert:</strong> This is the largest hot desert in the word. It is located in Africa. About 2 million people live in the desert. Most of them are Arabs or Berbers. Some people live in mud houses that are painted white. This is so to keep out heat during the daytime and protect the people from cold evenings. Nomads in Africa live in tents and move around all year in search of areas with water.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Kalahari Deserts:</strong> &nbsp;This is located in southern Africa and covers most of Botswana and parts Namibia and South Africa.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Gobi Desert:</strong> It covers parts of northern and western China and parts of southern Mongolia. Gobi Desert is a cold desert due to its elevation above sea level. As such there are occasional snow on the dunes and even frost formations.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>Other deserts include Antarctic desert, Arabian desert, Patagonian Desert, Mohave desert, and Australian desert etc. Desertification affects about one sixth of the world\'s population, 70% of all dry lands, amounting to. 3.6million hectares and one quarter of the total land of the world.%%%%005%%%% <strong>Fig 4.1 map of Nigeria showing desert prone areas</strong> </p>\r\n<p><strong>Desertification:</strong> it usually occurs land dunes encroach into areas where people live and gradually take over the place. The wind helps very much in the movement of sand dunes. The process is called saltation.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h4>Unit 3</h4>\r\n<p>A combination of natural factors and human activities have contributed to desertification. Precisely, the causes are:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>Over-Grazing: </strong>This means excessive use of the same pastures. When we allow livestock to graze on the grasses on an available land for several times, this may result to erosion and loss of total vegetation; and eventually desertification.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Deforestation: </strong>Felling of trees for firewood or timber may result to desertification.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Drought:</strong> &lsquo;This is the absence of rainfall over a period of time. As a result, plants and animals die due to lack of water. The absence of plants will imply that they will not be there again to bind the soil.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Human Over-Population:</strong> When a certain community region is over a certain community region is over-populated, especially if the people have scarce means of livelihood, they may resort to the destruction of tropical wet and dry forest due to much practices of slash and bum and other methods of subsistence farming.</li>\r\n<li>Excessive density of animals per area.</li>\r\n<li>Use of pastures not adapted to soils and climate conditions.</li>\r\n<li>Compaction of the soil surface by cattle.</li>\r\n<li>Appearance of a trail, which favours the action of runoffs.</li>\r\n<li>Incorrect agricultural practices like ploughing too deeply, successively and along slopes.</li>\r\n<li>Destruction of the soil structure and incorrection works (ploughing and others).</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h4>Unit 4</h4>\r\n<h4>Effects of Desertification</h4>\r\n<p>The effects or consequences of desertification are very grave, despite being a phenomenon that doesn&rsquo;t occur like a sudden catastrophe but progresses steadily in time. The main effects are:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Land-Abandonment: There is land abandonment by people following the loss of soil fertility. This is because there is loss in the quality of life of the population and of course this makes them to emigrate.</li>\r\n<li>As a consequence of these migratory movement, chaotic growth of receiving these migrates can occur, which means increasing unemployment and marginal behaviours as well as pollution and other environmental problems.</li>\r\n<li>It reduces the number of plants and animals in a given habitat.</li>\r\n<li>It brings about climatic changes in the due to changes in the vegetative cover.</li>\r\n<li>Break down of agricultural production and productivity</li>\r\n<li>Decrease of field and purchase power of the populations, poor economic development of the area etc.</li>\r\n<li>Oscillation of product process of regional and national markets.</li>\r\n<li>Social, economic and political instability.</li>\r\n<li>Increase of environmental problems due to the bad use of natural resources.</li>\r\n<li>Loss of biodiversity less variety of plants and animal.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h4>Unit 5</h4>\r\n<h4>&nbsp;</h4>\r\n<h4>Control of Desertification</h4>\r\n<p>&nbsp;Desertification is quite a grave phenomenon which is on course. As a result, governments and the governed must take measures to prevent its further advance or encroachment by doing the following:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>Reforestation</strong>: this means planting of new trees to replace the felled ones.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Afforestation:</strong> This involves 2 planting of new trees in such areas they never existed. This is aimed at preventing desert encroachment. Tree planting campaign should be encouraged in schools and local government areas of state the state.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Solar Energy: </strong>Renewable energy sources such as solar energy stoves should be encouraged. This should serve as an alternative to firewood and will reduce-the rate of cutting down of trees (deforestation) for firewood.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Application of Manure:</strong> - Manure should be applied to the soil to enrich it and enhance crop productivity and plant growth.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Practicing Crop Rotation:</strong> this measure is taken to protect and recover soil that is at the risk of being eroded away.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Building Sand Fences: </strong>When sand fences are erected, this will contro! drifting of soil and sand and even help in checking erosion.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Planting Special Crops and Trees:</strong> The planting of trees, leguminous crops and shelterbelts near our homes can assist prevent desert encroachment. Trees planted by the government should be maintained and sustained.</li>\r\n<li>Grazing animals should be confined in their stables and should not be seen in the field grazing.</li>\r\n<li>Over-grazing should be prohibited: In places where the cattle and other animals are left free to graze on the grasses, they should not be allowed to over-graze in a portion of land.</li>\r\n<li>Encouraging planting of thorny bushes or obstacles to scare and keep away grazing animals.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Planting of wind Breaks: </strong>This will help to prevent soil erosion by wind and subsequently preventing desert encouragement.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Irrigation System:</strong> construction of dams for irrigation as well as the establishment of River Basin Development Authorities should be adopted in areas where there is drought to recover plant growth.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Moran Population Control:</strong> Nigeria has a large population of about 140 million by 2006 census. The land is fixed while the population keeps on growing. The increasing demand for land could be over-stressing the natural resources especially in northern Nigeria and thereby making human activity a determining factor at all stages of desertification. Consequently, measures should be taken to check human population growth such as family planning programme.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>The establishment of Federal Environmental Protection Agency (FEPA) is a step in the right direction undertaken by the Federal Government of Nigeria for the purpose of addressing the multifarious environmental problems (including drought and desertification). The FEPA facilitated the establishment of State Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA) in the 36 states of the Federation and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). It is the mandate of SEPAs to address all the environmental problems/drought and desertification inclusive) in each State.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>Sub-Topic: Depletion of Ozone Layer and its Effect</h3>\r\n<h3>Introduction</h3>\r\n<p>&nbsp;Ozone layer depletion is one of the most serious problems confronting our planet earth. It is also one of the prime reasons leading to global warming. Ozone is a colourless gas which is found in the stratosphere of our upper atmosphere. The layer of ozone protects us from the harmful ultraviolent (uv) radiations of the sun. It does this by absorbing these harmful UV radiations and thus prevents these rays from entering the earth\'s atmosphere. UV radiations are high energy electromagnetic waves emitted by the sun which if it enters the earth&rsquo;s atmosphere can lead to various environmental issues including global warning and also a number of health-related issues for all living organisms. Thanks to ozone layer which protects us from these harmful rays. In this unit, we shall learn about substances that deplete ozone layer and its effects, ozone layer description and its location and control measures etc.</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<h4>Unit 6</h4>\r\n<h4>Description of the ozone layer and its location in the Atmosphere</h4>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p>Ozone is a form of oxygen. It Contains three atoms, of oxygen (i.e. triatomic) (O3). Ozone is a colourless gas found in the upper atmosphere of the earth called Stratosphere. At the Stratosphere, the amount of ozone is relatively high, about 10ppm (parts per million) while at the earth surface it is about 0.04ppm. %%%%007%%%%<strong>Fig 4.5: The atmosphere showing the ozone layer.</strong></p>\r\n<p>There are three forms (or allotropes) of oxygen and these are involved in the ozone-oxygen cycle: oxygen atoms (O or atomic oxygen), oxygen gas (O<sub>2</sub>) or diatomic oxygen) and ozone gas (O<sub>3</sub> or triatomic oxygen).</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h5>Formation of Ozone layer/Ozone Cycle</h5>\r\n<p>Ozone 1s formed in the stratosphere when oxygen molecules (O<sub>2</sub>) absorb UV light (photons) and undergo a chemical reaction known as photo dissociation or photolysis. In this, a single molecule of oxygen breaks down into two atoms. O, Photons of energy O + O (oxygen radicals are active) UV light</p>\r\n<p>Then the free and reactive oxygen atom now combines with an oxygen molecule (O<sub>2</sub>) to form a molecule of Ozone (O<sub>3</sub>)</p>\r\n<p>O + O<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub></p>\r\n<p>The ozone molecules in turn absorbs UV rays between 310 to 200nm (nanometers) wavelength (310200nm) and thereby prevent these harmful radiations from entering the earth\'s atmosphere. The process of absorption of harmful radiation occurs when ozone molecules split up into a molecule of oxygen gas and an oxygen atom. The oxygen atom (O), again combines with the oxygen molecule (O<sub>2</sub>) to regenerate an ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) molecule, thus the total amount of ozone is maintained by this continuous process of destruction and regeneration.</p>\r\n<p>O+O<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;O3</p>\r\n<p><strong>Note: </strong></p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>The amount of zone present in the stratosphere is determined by what remains from the light absorption and recombination process.</li>\r\n<li>Ozone is also produced during thunderstorms or lightening. The electrical spark discharged by thunder is passed through ova gas (O<sub>2</sub>) in the atmosphere produce Ozone.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lightening</p>\r\n<p>3O<sub>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &rarr; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </sub>2O<sub>3 </sub></p>\r\n<p>3molecules of oxygen &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2 molecules of ozone.</p>\r\n<ol start=\"3\">\r\n<li>Ozone is also formed around electrical generating plants or set.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<h4>Unit 7</h4>\r\n<h4>Importance of Ozone Layer</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Ozone layer provides a natural shield from UV radiations which are high energy electromagnetic waves emitted from the sun which cause skin cancer and skin bums etc.</li>\r\n<li>The UV rays cause cataracts of the eve which can lead to blindness in man.</li>\r\n<li>The UV rays destroy some cyno-bacteria plant roots e.g. rice plant which yield or add nitrogen to the soil but ozone will prevent such an action.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h5>Depletion of Ozone</h5>\r\n<p>Ozone depletion may be seen as a slow reduction in the soil total volume or amount of ozone in the earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. Another view says that it is a steady decline of about 4% in the total amount of ozone in Earth&rsquo;s stratosphere (the ozone layer). Events in the recent years have shown that ozone layer (shield) is destroyed by substances which are of human and natural origin.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<h4>Unit 8</h4>\r\n<h4>Causes of Ozone Layer Depletion</h4>\r\n<p>There are substances which are contributory to the depletion of ozone layer. These substances are referred to as <strong>ozone-depletion substance (ODS).</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>One of the processes leading to ozone layer depletion is by atomic halogens. The main source of these halogen atoms in the stratosphere is the photodissociation of man-made halocarbon refrigerants, solvents, propellants and foam-blowing agents such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFC), hydrogen chlorofluro carbons HCFCs, Freons and halon.</li>\r\n<li>Similarly, bromine atoms in the form of bromofluorocarbons (BFCs) commonly called halons release bromine atoms which move to the stratosphere also catalyzing the breakdown of ozone layer.</li>\r\n<li>Burning process, exhaust fumes of motor cars and generating sets.</li>\r\n<li>Naturally, some important radicals that have been associated with ozone layer depletion are hydroxyl group (-OH) and nitric oxide (NO-) both have natural and man-made sources.</li>\r\n<li>It has been found that large volcanic eruptions have been shown to have massive ozone depleting effects as observed, for example, with the 1991 eruption of mountain pinotubo in the Philippines. Such eruptions can layer Pour hydrochloric acid (HCL) to as ozone-depletion substance directly into the stratosphere causing ozone-depletion since it contains chlorine.</li>\r\n<li>Space shuttle can also release HCL to the atmosphere resulting in the depletion of ozone layer.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h4>Unit 9</h4>\r\n<h4>&nbsp;</h4>\r\n<h4>Effects of Depletion of Ozone Layer</h4>\r\n<p>&nbsp;As ozone layer depletes in the stratosphere, it forms a &ldquo;hole&rdquo; (or a depression) in the layer. This hole enables harmful UV rays to enter the Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. UV rays of the sun are associated with a number of health related and environmental issues. Let us take a look at how ozone depletion affects different life form.</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<h5>Impact on Humans</h5>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>Skin Cancer</strong>: Exposure to ultraviolet rays poses an increased risk of developing several types of skin cancers, including malignant melanoma, basal and squamous cell carcinoma.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Eye Damage</strong>: Direct exposure to UV. radiations can result in photokeratitis (show blindness) and cataracts.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Immune System Damage:</strong> Effects of UV include impairment of the immune system. Increased exposure to UV ray&rsquo;s weakness the response of the immune system.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Accelerated aging of Skin:</strong> Constant exposure to UV radiation can cause photo allergy which results in the outbreak of rash in fair-skinned people. Also, an increase in the amount of UV rays results to increased production of vitamin D which protects the skin against cancer in man.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p><strong>Other effects</strong>: Ozone layer depleting chemicals can cause difficulty in breathing, chest-pain, throat irritation and hamper lung functioning.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h5>Impact on Amphibians</h5>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Hampers growth and development in larvae.</li>\r\n<li>Changes behaviors and habitats.</li>\r\n<li>Causes deformities in some species</li>\r\n<li>Decreases immunity. Some species have become more vulnerable to diseases and death.</li>\r\n<li>Retinal damage and blindness in some species.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h5>Impact on Marine Animals and Ecosystem</h5>\r\n<p>In particular, Plankton (Phytoplankton and Bacterioplankton) are threatened by increased UV radiation. Marine phytoplankton play a fundamental role in both the food chain as well as the oceanic carbon cycle. Planktons play an important role in converting atmospheric carbondioxide into oxygen.</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<h5>Impact on plants.</h5>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>In some species of plants, UV radiation can alter the time of flowering as well as the number of flowers.</li>\r\n<li>Plant growth can be directly affected by UV radiation. Despite mechanisms to reduce or repair these effects, physiological and developmental processes of plants are affected.</li>\r\n<li>Ozone produced at the ground level by exhaust fumes of motor vehicles and generating sets is dangerous to human health.</li>\r\n<li>The depletion of ozone layer results IN cooling in the stratosphere which invariably affects global warming and melting of ice by reducing the occurrence of these phenomena.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h4>Unit 10</h4>\r\n<h4>Control Measures on Ozone Layer Depletion</h4>\r\n<p>Ozone layer depletion is something that affects not only a country or region but the whole world is vulnerable to its after effects. It is important for each and every one of us to take actions to reduce ozone layer depletion</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Nations all over the world should observe the 1987 Montreal Protocol agreements reached on the reduction and control of industrial chlorofluorocarbons.</li>\r\n<li>There should be international regulations in the use chlorofluorocarbons.</li>\r\n<li>The use of chlorofluorocarbons compounds in aerosol cans propellants, Freons and halons should be stopped. Compounds that do not produce chlorine atoms which are more environmentally friendly may be obtained through scientific research.</li>\r\n<li>Bromofluorocarbon compounds that release bromine to the environment should be banned.</li>\r\n<li>A conscious effort should be made by all and sundry and reduce ozone layer depletion by buying recycled products saving of energy, using a &lsquo;public&rsquo; transport and. thereby reducing the number of motor cars on the road and quantities of CFCs emissions in the atmosphere.</li>\r\n<li>Bush burning and all burnings should be banned.</li>\r\n<li>Public education will help in creating and spreading the awareness on the dangers in using CFCs.</li>\r\n<li>Individuals efforts will go a long way in saving the earth\'s blanket (shield) and keep our planet earth livable for us and our future generations.</li>\r\n<li>Students should identify and list sources of CFCS.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>', 'JSS 1', 'Basic Science', '2021-10-12 15:31:36', '2021-10-12 15:31:36'),

The reason is that there is need for controlled use of drugs through professional prescription. No doubt this will help to prevent the painful effects of drug abuse.</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<h4>Unit 1</h4>\r\n<h4>Effects of Drug Abuse</h4>\r\n<p>Drug abuse refers to the use of drugs especially by self-administration in such a way that it deviates from an approved medical or social pattern with a given culture or society. It could also be defined as the consumption of a substance (drug) in amounts or methods which are harmful to the user or others. Simply put, drug is abused.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>When it is taken without a medical personnel or doctors\" prescription. It is the misuse or improper way of using drugs. Some drugs could be legal while some others are illegal.

Plants and animals are very useful to man because they provide man with food, clothing raw materials for building, medicine and clothing These useful things which man derives from plants and animals are called resources. Natural resources like coal and petroleum (crude oil) are derived from dead aquatic plants and animals. These are sources of manure and contribute to soil enrichment and fertility. In this unit, we shall learn about the main resources human beings derive from plants and animals and their importance.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h4>Unit 1</h4>\r\n<h4>&nbsp;Resources from Living Things</h4>\r\n<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Resources from living things can be defined as those useful materials we obtain from plants and animals such as food clothing and medicine just to mention but a few.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h5>Resources from Plants</h5>\r\n<p>We derive many resources from plants which may be grouped as follows:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Food crops</li>\r\n<li>Industrial crops</li>\r\n<li>Medicinal crops</li>\r\n<li>Wood crops</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<h5>These are further discussed:</h5>\r\n<h5>&nbsp;Food Crops</h5>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Green plants manufacture their own food in the presence of energy from the sun through the process of photosynthesis. Hence green plants are referred to as food producers. There are special of the Where the manufactured food stored. These parts include leaves seeds and roots etc These edible parts of plants are called vegetables which can be grouped as. follows</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>Leafy Vegetables</strong>. These are mainly the edible leaves of plants Some of the leaves are eaten in their raw form such as Spinach, lettuce cabbage, celery, All, these can be put together and eaten as salads. However, others are eaten cooked such as waterleaf, bitter-leaf, fluted pumpkin (ugu) and so on.</li>\r\n<li>F<strong>ruits:</strong> Fruits are very important to man because they provide us with vitamins, water and mineral salts. These give protection to the body against infections and also fruits contain sugar which. when metabolized can give energy to the body. Examples of fruits are pawpaw, mango, orange apple, garden egg, pineapple, lemon, lime, &ldquo;banana, ogbono, ukpo, mato, okro, cashew fruit, guava, pepper, fig tree and so on.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Seeds/Grains:</strong> The seeds ang grains/cereals of plants are most eaten cooked. They are very important because they are sources of starch fat and protein Examples of such plants with seeds or grains are maize wheat, rice, beans, sorghum, groundnut, barley, guinea com, cowpea and soya bean etc</li>\r\n<li><strong>Underground Crops</strong>: The foods stored in these crops make them to look swollen and usually found in the soil. These consists of stem-tubers, root-tubers, bulb, com, rhizome etc. They are mostly eaten cooked but some can be used as spices.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Oil Plants</strong>: These are plants that mainly provides us with vegetable oil for cooking and for other purposes. Examples are coconut, groundnut, soya bean, cotton, oil palm, shear butter and castor oil.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h5>Industrial crops</h5>\r\n<p>These are crops grown for their various industrial applications.</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>Crops for textile industry: </strong>Cotton plant provides cotton fibre used to make pillows, cloths, mattresses, thread and so on. This plant is mostly grown in the northern part of Nigeria. Winnowing trays and baskets are made from the bark of bamboo palm while the trunk is used to make local beds.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Cosmetic Industry:</strong> Cosmetics are makeups substances which are applied on the body mainly on the skin in order to improve natural features of an individual and protect the skin from dryness. Some of the cosmetics are: Lali or Lallee, Camwood powder &ldquo;Uhe&rdquo; (Igbo) or &ldquo;Oshun&rdquo; (Yoruba) etc.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Bakery industry: </strong>Bakery industry uses wheat. flour to make chin-chin, bread, cake etc. Maize flour is also used to make similar products.</li>\r\n<li>Yeast, a non-green plant (fungus) is used to make bread rise (dough) during bakery.</li>\r\n<li>Yeast is also used for fermentation during alcohol production (beer).</li>\r\n<li>Maize is used to make alcohol in beer production.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<h5>Medicinal Crops</h5>\r\n<p>These are crops grown mainly for their medicinal values. Their roots, barks, leaves are used as drugs for the treatment of various ailments/disease. Examples are as follows:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Penicillium (a fungus) is a non-green plant used to produce antibiotic, penicillin for treating diseases including the eye. Some of the plants are used to heal wounds, to cure indigestion, constipation, laxatives (soften stool) and to control stooling. For example,</li>\r\n<li>&ldquo;dogonyaro&rdquo; is used for the treatment of malaria.</li>\r\n<li>Bitter kola is used to treat stomach upset especially in children. It is also used in the treatment of cough and high blood pressure.</li>\r\n<li>Bitter kola has the capacity to block everything poisonous coming into the body.</li>\r\n<li>Aloe Vera plant heals wounds and stomach problems.</li>\r\n<li>Nchanwu (Igbo) has been found very useful in the treatment of jadi jadi (in children) food seasoning and also for fightng high blood pressure and diabetes</li>\r\n<li>Bitter leaves can be used in the treatment of minor cuts wounds to aid blood clot.</li>\r\n<li>Bryophylum plants stops inflammation.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<h5>Wood Crops</h5>\r\n<p>These are plants that provide us with hardwood (timber) and soft wood.</p>\r\n<p>Wood crops that are naturally hard and tough are called hardwoods.</p>\r\n<p>Examples are iroko, ebony, mahogany, obeche, camphor and so on.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h5>Cash Crops</h5>\r\n<p>These are Crops usually grown for sale in order to make money. Examples are groundnut, coconut, cocoa, rubber, coffee, tobacco, kola nu, cotton, oil palm etc.</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<h4>Unit 2</h4>\r\n<h4>Resources from Animals</h4>\r\n<p>Animals provide us with food rich in protein for growth and repair of dead and worm-out tissues. The keeping of animals for food and/or sale is called livestock farming are cow, goat, sheep, buffalo, snail, pig, chicken (bird) and so on.</p>\r\n<h5>Importance of Livestock Farming</h5>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>Aquaculture/Fish farming: </strong>Aquaculture means fish farming. It refers to the growing or rearing of fishes, crab, crayfish, prawn and other water organisms in an artificial or man-made water bodies known as fish ponds. The practice of aquaculture is mainly to produce large quantities of fish for people to eat and produce beautiful coloured fish to be kept in home aquarium and ponds as decoration. Fishery is an aspect of aquaculture that deals on rearing fish alone.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Poultry keeping:</strong> The term &ldquo;poultry&rdquo; refers to all species of domesticated birds. it is the science of raising birds such as chicken, guinea fowl, turkey, duck, pigeon and goose. Poultry is raised mainly for money, meat and eggs. poultry also provides poultry dung used by farmers for enriching soil fertility. Other products include feathers for making pillows, materials and as ornamentals won the caps of titled men<strong>.</strong></li>\r\n<li><strong>Diary Farming: </strong>This is the practice whereby animals are reared mainly for the purpose of milk production and may be salvaged for meat after milking. They usually have well-developed udder and teats and a docile temperature. Animals like cows, buffalos, goat, sheep, horses are reared for this purpose.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Hides and Skins:</strong> Hides are skins which are also obtained from livestock. &ldquo;Hide\" is the skin of large animals like cow, horse, camel etc while &ldquo;skin&rdquo; is the skin of small animals such as goat, sheep, ram and so on. Hides and skins provide us with mainly leather as a product.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Beast of Burden:</strong> These are animals kept for labour and or series such animals include: donkey, elephant or horses, mule, camels. They give such services as carrying loads, transportation, recreation, pulling a plow, ploughing or doing any other heavy work. This practice is common in the northern part of Nigeria such as Sokoto, Yobe, Adamawa, Bauchi, Kano and so on.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h4>&nbsp;</h4>\r\n<h4>Unit 3</h4>\r\n<h4>Economic Importance of Resources from living things to Self-Development</h4>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Man is provided with sufficient food for healthy growth and development.</li>\r\n<li>They provide man with certain drugs for the preservation and treatment of some diseases; this prolongs the life of man.</li>\r\n<li>The provide opportunities for self-employment such as poultry, fishery piggery, snailry, etc</li>\r\n<li>They raise the standard of living of a person as the products are sold for money. It creates wealth.</li>\r\n<li>They provide parents money to be able to train their children in education.</li>\r\n<li>Resources from living things provide man with materials for shelter and clothing.</li>\r\n<li>Man uses materials for sports, farming and transport especially across the hot.</li>\r\n<li>The manure, animal droppings enrich the soil and increase plant/crop yield.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h5>&nbsp;Economic Importance of Resources from Living things to Societal Development</h5>\r\n<p>They are as follows:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Bakeries and other food processing industries provide enough food for growing population.</li>\r\n<li>The rapid springing up of Industries bring about urbanization and development.</li>\r\n<li>They create job opportunities for the teaming unemployed youth into such industries as brewery, bakery, tobacco, dairy factories, textiles, beverages etc.</li>\r\n<li>Cash crops are foreign exchange earners to the country, thus increasing the gross domestic product (GDP) of the country hence improving standard of living.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>The money from the products could be used to pay taxes and the government uses the money derived from tax payment for the provision of social amenities for national development.</p>', 'JSS 1', 'Basic Science', '2021-10-12 15:57:34', '2021-10-12 15:57:34');

Examples are moon, the candle light, torchlight, fluorescent light, electric lamp and so on.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h5>Rays and beams of light</h5>\r\n<p>The direction or path along which light energy travels is called a ray.

Example, a hand lens can be used to produce such a beam.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Divergent Beam:</strong> This is one in which the light rays come from a point and spread out or diverge from the source.

Rays of light can be transmitted through a vacuum, transparent bodies, translucent bodies and opaque bodies. The amount of light passing through a body depends on the nature of the body. Light passes through a vacuum and reaches us on the earth&rsquo;s surface. When light passes through a vacuum and very little is absorbed, we call such material <strong>transparent</strong>. Example glass, water, etc. <strong>Translucent</strong> bodies allow small amount of light to pass through them Examples include: frosted glass, tissue paper, oiled paper, etc. They are not clear because we cannot see objects through them. There are opaque materials which do not allow light to pass through them at all. All the light is which either reflected or absorbed. Examples are wood, bricks, wall, metal sheets.</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<h5>Unit3&nbsp;</h5>\r\n<h5>Reflection of Light</h5>\r\n<p>When we shine light (say from torch) on a surface, part of the light will pass through, some will be absorbed by the surface, while some part will be thrown back or sent back. The ones thrown back are referred to as reflected rays.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;Reflection of light is sending or, transmission of Light throwing back light wave When it strikes a surface. Most objects can reflect Light, Objects with smooth, shiny or light coloured surfaces can reflect more light than with rough, dull or dark coloured surfaces.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h5>Types of Reflection</h5>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Reflection from Smooth surfaces like mirrors is regular. The mirror produces regular reflection because parallel beam of light is reflected in one direction and not scattered. This is due to the smoothness and high polished nature of the reflection.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>Reflection from rough surfaces is irregular or diffused. This is because of lack of smoothness or grain of the surface. Paper and clothing material give out irregular reflection. The reflection is said to be scared or diffused reflected. %%%%015%%%% <strong>Fig 8.2&nbsp; Reflection on both rough and smooth surfaces</strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<h5>Laws of reflection</h5>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The incident ray, the reflected ray and the normal, at the point of incidence all lie on the plane.</li>\r\n<li>The angle of incident is usually equal to the angle of reflection.%%%%018%%%%<strong>Fig 8.3</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<h5>Image Formation by a plane mirror</h5>\r\n<p>when you look at mirror you see the picture of yourself in the mirror which is an image. An image is something that looks very real but not the real thing itself. An image is formed when reflecting surface reflect most of the light that falls on it.</p>\r\n<p>The image always appears to be of the same size. It appears to lie as far behind the mirror as the object is in front of the mirror. The image appears to have been turned around sideways (lateral inversion).</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<h5>Description</h5>\r\n<p>When an object is placed in front of a plane mirror, two ray&rsquo;s AC and AD strike the mirror at points C and D.

The eye sees the image at B in such a way that ANB is perpendicular to the, Mirror.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<h5>Characteristics of Image Formed by a plane mirror</h5>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The image is the same size as the object.</li>\r\n<li>The image is formed at the back of the mirror (virtual) or the image is not real</li>\r\n<li>The image is laterally inverted (appears to have been turned around).</li>\r\n<li>The image is as far behind the mirror as the object is in front of the Mirror:</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<h4>Unit 4</h4>\r\n<h4>&nbsp;Refraction of Light</h4>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Sometimes, light rays&rsquo; incident on a surface may not bounce off from the surface, instead the light rays pass through it but in doing so, they bend from their original path. This phenomenon is called refraction. Refraction therefore is the bending of light ray as it passes from one transparent substance to another such as air to water and vice versa. In other words, refraction is the bending of a light ray as it crosses the boundary between two media of different densities, thus causing a change in its direction. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>This bending by refraction makes it possible for us to have lenses, magnifying glasses, prisms and rainbows. Even our eyes depend upon this bending of light. Without refraction, we would not be able to focus light onto our retina. Change of speed causes change of direction. That is, light changes its direction whenever it travels at an angle to a substance with a different optical density (refractive index). This change of direction is caused by a change in speed. when light travels from air to water, slows down, causing it to continue to travel at a different angle or direction as shown. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<h4>Unit 5</h4>\r\n<h4>Laws of refraction</h4>\r\n<p>The laws of refraction were propounded by Snell and the law states thus;</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The incident ray, the normal and the refracted ray, at the point of incidence all lie on the same plane</li>\r\n<li>The ratio of the sine of angle of incidence to the sine of angle of refraction is constant for a given pair of media i.e $\\frac{sin~i}{sin~r}$ = constant</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;Hence $\\frac{sin~i}{sin~r}$ &nbsp;= &micro;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;where &micro; = refractive index of the material, i</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;This is known as Snell&rsquo;s law. %%%%021%%%%<strong>Refraction of light</strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h4>Unit 6</h4>\r\n<h4>Effects of Refraction</h4>\r\n<p>The effects of refraction at plane surfaces help us to explain our day to day observations.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>A partially immersed straight stick or pencil appears bent at the boundary between the air and the water. But if the pencil/stick is standing upright, it appears shorter.</li>\r\n<li>A coin in a bow or glass beaker is invisible to the observer when no water is in the bowl, but if sufficient water is poured into the bowl, refraction will occur at the air &mdash; water boundary, then it will cause the coin to be visible to the eye and it would appear to be raised above the depth of the beaker.</li>\r\n<li>A swimming pool appears shallower when we look down into it than it actually is. Hence, refraction of light at the surface of water makes pond and swimming pools Parts of the Eye and appears shallower than they really are. This shows that apparent depth is smaller than the real depth. For this reason, amateur swimmers should always check the mark of the depth before entering the pools otherwise, they may get drowned.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<h4>Unit 7</h4>\r\n<h4>(The human Eye) Vision</h4>\r\n<p>Our eye is the most important natural diaphragm which has a small optical instrument. The eye is nearly spherical in shape with a slight bulge in front part. The eye is the sense organ for sight; it enables us to see things like the camera.

The pupil appears black because the inner layer of the eye, the choroid, is black and has no light to reflect.</li>\r\n<li><strong>The Eye Lens:</strong> the eye lens is a convex lens made of a transparent jelly-like proteinous material. It is the eye lens that focuses the light from the object on to the light sensitive retina.</li>\r\n<li><strong>The Retina:</strong> the inner back surface of the eyeball is called retina. It is a semi-transparent membrane which is light-sensitive. It is on the retina that the image is formed.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Optic Nerve:</strong> the optic nerve is connected to the retina.

Example; the ringing of the alarm-clock and the whistle of the referee. We can make sound in many ways: by shouting, clapping our hands or banging a table or blowing a whistle, in each of these, something is made to vibrate.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h4>Unit 1</h4>\r\n<h4>Production of Sound Waves</h4>\r\n<p>When an object vibrates, it disturbs the surrounding air causing waves to travel outwards in all directions. The disturbance travels out from the source of vibration in the form of longitudinal waves. Sound waves cannot travel through vacuum, a material medium is always required for the passage of sound. Such medium includes solid, liquid and gas. Sound can be produced by plucking the string of guitar, playing musical instruments, rubbing, blowing of whistles, shaking different objects, when a group of soldiers are marching during parade, sound is equally produced. This shows that&rsquo; vibrating objects produce sounds. Vibration is a rapid to-and-fro motion of an object. Example; human voice produces sound due to vibrations in the vocal cords.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: there are sounds that cannot be heard by man, they can be heard by animals like snakes, bats. those sounds are called infrasonic sounds. Their frequencies are below 20Hz. &ndash; Some sounds are within human hearing range of frequencies between &lsquo;4000Hz &mdash; 20,000HZz, they are called <strong>limit of audibility</strong> and they vary from person to person. While some sounds have frequency range above 20,000HZ, those ones are called <strong>ultrasonic sounds.</strong> Ultrasonic sounds are dangerous to the ear as they can cause deafness.</p>\r\n<h5>Uses of sounds</h5>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Destroying bacteria in water</li>\r\n<li>Clearing smoke in the air</li>\r\n<li>drying papers</li>\r\n<li>used in cleaning metals</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<h5>Sources of sounds</h5>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>Soldiers marching during parade</strong></li>\r\n<li><strong>Vibrating Tuning Fork: </strong>The tuning fork has two steel prongs which Speed of Sound vibrate when struck with a hard rubber, giving some sounds</li>\r\n<li><strong>Musical Instrument:</strong> This musical instrument is of three types.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Wind Instrument:</strong> They produce sound through a vibrating column of air, example; flutes, trumpets, saxophones etc.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Stringed instruments:</strong> Example; Guitar, sonometer, piano, violin, etc.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Percussion instrument:</strong> A percussion instrument produces sound when it is hit or struck, they have taut skin membranes, rods or plates which vibrate when struck. The sound produced is usually of short duration. Examples; talking drums, bells, gongs, xylophone, and soon.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p><strong>Note: </strong>sound as a form of energy can be transformed into other forms of energy -obeying the law of conservation of energy; which States that in an open or closed system energy can be transformed from one form to another but the total energy of, the system remains the same. Example the telephone receiver changes electrical impulses into sound after converting it to mechanical energy.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h5>Factors affecting the speed of sound.</h5>\r\n<p><strong>Temperature: </strong>Speed of sound is directly proportional to the square root of absolute temperature. Hence, the higher the temperature, the higher the speed of sound. This is why sound travels faster in a sunny day than in a colder day.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Wind: </strong>The speed of sound increases, if sound travels in the same direction as the wind and decreases if sound travels in the opposite direction. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Density of the Medium</strong>: speed of sound is inversely proportional to the square root of the density. Hence, the higher the density, the lesser the speed of sound. Pressure, pitch and loudness have no effect on the speed of sound.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h4>Unit 4</h4>\r\n<h4>Reflection of Sound</h4>\r\n<p>Like other waves, sound wave can be reflected. When sound wave strikes a smooth surface, the sound will be thrown back, so that one hears the sound a second time.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Echo: </strong>A sound heard after the reflection of sound waves from a plane surface is called an echo. That is, an echo is the reflection of sound wave heard when it meets an obstacle or a barrier.</p>\r\n<h4>Unit 5</h4>\r\n<h4>Uses of Echo The determination of speed of sound in air.</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The determination of speed of sound</li>\r\n<li>The determination of the depth of sea bed.</li>\r\n<li>Used in oil and gas exploration.</li>\r\n<li>In locating shoal of fish.</li>\r\n<li>Used in detecting flaws in metal casting.</li>\r\n<li>In medical ultrasound, etc.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h4>Unit 6</h4>\r\n<h4>Hearing</h4>\r\n<p>&nbsp;Hearing is defined as a sense concerned with the perception of sound. Human ear is the sense organ that responds to the stimulus of sound, that is, it allows us to hear sound produced around us. The human ear is typically described as consisting of three parts;</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The outer flap or external part</li>\r\n<li>The middle part, and</li>\r\n<li>The inner part.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The ear plays an important role in the process of delivering sounds to the brain. It is only the mechanism to transmit the sound. It is in the brain where the sounds are actually heard and given meaning. %%%%027%%%% <strong>Fig 9.1 The Ear</strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>The Outer Ear:</em></strong> This consists of the pinna (the structure on the side of the head), the ear canal and the tympanic membrane (ear drum).

Attached to the eardrum is the first of three small bones (ossicles) commonly referred to as the hammer, anvil and stirrup. When the sound wave collected by the pinna and enhanced as they travel down the ear Canal strike the ear drum, the ossicles are set into motion. Here the acoustic energy from the sound has now been converted to mechanical energy.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>The Inner Ear:</em></strong> The inner part of the ear is a fluid filled space comprising of the cochlea, semi-circular canals and other structures. The cochlea houses the sensory organ of hearing. The semi-circular canals and other Structures house the sensory organ for balance. The stirrup bone pivots in the interior wall of the middle ear Causing movement of the fluid inside &lsquo;the cochlea. The cochlea is shaped like a snail curled around on itself.

They are naturally occurring magnets, which can attract iron. Loadstone is one of the only two minerals that is found naturally magnetized; the other one is <strong>pyrrhotite</strong> this one is a weak magnet. %%%%029%%%% <strong>Fig 10.1 loadstone attracting nails</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p>A <strong>magnet </strong>is defined as any material capable of attracting both steel and iron materials and can equally repel while Magnetic materials: are materials that can be attracted by a Magnet. Example: cobalt, iron, nickel and certain alloys.</p>\r\n<p>Some objects are not attracted by magnets, they are called nonmagnetic materials or substances. Example; wood, glass, _ plastics, copper, brass, paper, thread, cotton wool, etc. A magnetic substance can be made into a magnet, but a nonmagnetic substance cannot be made into a magnet. The ends of a magnet where the attracting power is greatest are called the poles. The pole which points towards the north is called the North (N) pole of the magnet, while the other one is called the South (S) pole. %%%%032%%%%<strong>Fig.10 showing the North (N) and South</strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>(S) pole of a magnet</strong></p>\r\n<p>The same poles of a magnet are called like poles, while different poles are called unlike poles. If the North pole of a magnet is brought closer to the North pole of another magnet, repulsion occurs, but if North pole is brought near to the South pole of another magnet, attraction occurs. %%%%033%%%%<strong>Fig 10.2a</strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h4>Unit 2</h4>\r\n<h4>Laws of Magnetism</h4>\r\n<p><strong>The law states that</strong>:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Like Poles Repel and Unlike Poles attract each other.</li>\r\n<li>Equality of Poles of Magnets: the pole strength at the two ends of a magnet is always equal in magnitude but opposite in nature</li>\r\n<li>Inseparability of Poles: - if a bar &lsquo;magnet is actually cut into two parts; each part becomes an independent magnet having two opposite poles.

Although, this field cannot be seen, its presence can be demonstrated and mapped out using compass needle. Such a needle when placed near the magnet will swing around and settle in a definite direction showing that a sort of force is present. The compass needle is a sensitive instrument for finding the direction of the magnetic field.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: the direction of the field or line of magnetic force at any point is taken as the direction in which N-pole placed at that point will tend to move.</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Unit 4 </strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Patterns of Magnetic Field </strong></p>\r\n<p>Magnetic field patterns can conveniently be observed using iron fillings.

This is the best way of demagnetizing a magnet.</li>\r\n<li>Keepers are soft iron pieces kept between the poles of permanent magnets while they are stored. Keepers are placed across each end of a pair of bar magnet placed with opposite poles next to each other to help reduce self-demagnetization of magnets.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<h4>Unit 8</h4>\r\n<h4>Types of Magnets</h4>\r\n<p><strong>Temporary magnet:</strong> - This one can be easily magnetized and equally easily demagnetized once the magnetic material is removed.</p>\r\n<p>Example; soft iron and electromagnets.

A fuse is an electrical device that comprises a short length of a flexible wire of low melting point. The main Purpose of the fuse is to cut off the flow of current in a Circuit when the flow of current is in excess to prevent the destruction of the appliance Connected to it or prevent fire Outbreak. When current flowing rises above that which is expected in which the fuse is connected, heat develops and cuts the fuse wires i.e. melts the fuse wire resulting in the stoppage of current flow. %%%%053%%%%<strong>Fig 11.4 A fuse</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<h4>Unit 5</h4>\r\n<h4>Circuit Breaker</h4>\r\n<p>A circuit breaker is device that cuts off current when voltage level is higher than normal.

It is distributed round the house to sockets, and appliances are connected to the supply of electricity by pushing plugs into the sockets. However, house wiring usually involves three types of wires: the live (L), the neutral (N) and the earth (E) wires. The live and neutral carry the current. However, the live wire is much more dangerous than the neutral because of its high voltage. The neutral wire is earthed at the power station, and so, its voltage is not as high as that of the live wire. The earth wire carries no current. It is just for safety purpose. The moment there is sign of current in the earth wire, it is an indication that the current in the circuit is faulty, the fuse would break so as to protect the electrical application in the house.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Colour codes</strong></p>\r\n<p>Electrical wire insulating colours for a 3-pin plug.</p>\r\n<table>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width=\"170\">\r\n<p><strong>Wire</strong></p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"170\">\r\n<p>Colour</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width=\"170\">\r\n<p>Live</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"170\">\r\n<p>Brown/Red</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width=\"170\">\r\n<p>Neutral</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"170\">\r\n<p>Blue/Black</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width=\"170\">\r\n<p>Earth</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"170\">\r\n<p>Green/Yellow/Green &amp;Yellow</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h4>Unit 7</h4>\r\n<h4>Electrical Components Used in House Wiring</h4>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>Fuse:</strong> the fuse/cut out is the Connection between the public power supply and the house.

For example, electricity which is needed to run our homes, industries, farms, businesses and offices is shrouded with great amount of risks that only those who are specially and specifically trained can afford to meddle with it for the supply of electrical energy. An amateur can easily be electrocuted or manipulate it to cause havoc to systems, properties and lives. A fishing ang fisherman has to acquire Swimming skills as fishing on high Sea is enormously risky. understand the complexities of certain objects, it becomes proper that the skills associated with them be learned and acquired for proper exploitation and management of the resources.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Skill acquisition helps us to take decision: </strong>Decision making is needed as one desires which skill to acquire. At acquiring the skill, he decides to use it for profiteering or for philanthropy. Skill acquisition could lead to taking a decision on what to embark on, what to produce and how to go about it.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ol start=\"3\">\r\n<li><strong>Managing emergency situation could be another reason for embarking on skill acquisition: </strong>Fire fighters and military strategists are particularly trained to contain emergency situations in terms of massive and sudden conflagration or security breakdown and insurgency. Medical doctors and nurses are also trained to handle outbreaks of pandemic diseases such as avian flu, swine flu, HIV/AIDS and most recently, the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD). Acquiring such professional skills could help in curbing such menace.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<ol start=\"4\">\r\n<li><strong>Survival strategy is yet another reason for skill acquisition: </strong>Basically, the essence learning a skill is to achieve economic self-sufficiency. A person without a Skill loses the chance to survive succeed socially and economically with a skill one can be engaged to eke-out a living. Skill acquisition is a strategy and means to life. The essence of employing or engaging a worker is to make him practice his skill for which he is rewarded.

The scripture challenged - Christians to work if they must eat (II Thess. 3:10). These have made people to learn skills in order to fit into the plan of God. In order to share in the joy of being part of production in the process of division of labour, people endeavour to acquire some &lsquo;Skills needed in such that production might take place.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<ol start=\"9\">\r\n<li><strong>Some engage in skills acquisition in order to domicile the Skill in the family, making it part of the culture and heritage:</strong> In like manner, some individuals learn skills in order to sustain or take charge of an established family business for perpetuity so as not to lose their accruing benefits.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h4>Unit 4</h4>\r\n<h4>Importance of Skill Acquisition</h4>\r\n<p>The importance of skill acquisition cannot be over emphasized. This is because skill acquisition explains _the usefulness and resourcefulness of man, his environment and natural resources. Skill acquisition is important in the following ways:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>It is through acquired skills that people are classified in order of resourcefulness and rewards.</li>\r\n<li>Through skill acquisition people experience improved quality of life.</li>\r\n<li>Through the expression of skills human capabilities are appreciated.</li>\r\n<li>Skill acquisition result in enhanced economic and social development.</li>\r\n<li>Owning to the importance of skill acquisition, governments and corporate institutions have built and established training centers.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h4>Unit 5</h4>\r\n<h4>&nbsp;How Skills can be Acquired</h4>\r\n<p>There are various ways of learning skills.

It is a science which tries to direct on how actions can be right, fair, generally useful to all and beneficial for good life or good living. In other words, ethics passes judgment on actions and behaviour of man showing whether they are good, just, right, fair, beneficial or bad, unjust, wrong, unfair or even harmful to man and his environment.</p>\r\n<p>We can define ethics as a normative Science of the conduct of human beings living in societies. A science which judges the rightness and wrongness of conduct or the goodness or badness of action. Thus, ethics is the science of conduct or science of morals concerned with human character and conducts. It is a code of moral principles that govern or influence a person\'s behaviour. Ethics is generally referred to as moral <strong>philosophy</strong>. It is not only a guide to human behaviour and actions but also a guide to ideas, rules, laws, norms, customs, traditions, scientific theories, application and technologies. Nothing escapes its judgment. Its major objective is to ensure that actions and behaviour are rightly done. It protects individuals from - physical, psychological, spiritual and personal harm as a result of other people\'s behaviour, actions, ideas or application of technologies.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h4>Unit 2</h4>\r\n<h4>Right Wrong Application of Science</h4>\r\n<p>Science can be said to be an investigation or inquiry of or about things using experiments and observation. Scientific activities have three major components namely scientific attitudes, scientific processes and scientific products.</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>Scientific Attitudes: </strong>scientific attitudes are concerned with values beliefs and scientific behaviours investigation involving.</li>\r\n<li>Suspending judgment until Sufficient data about the problem have been collected.</li>\r\n<li>Curiosity about things or events</li>\r\n<li>Expecting failure where possible</li>\r\n<li>Being open-minded.</li>\r\n<li>Approaching issues/things objectively i.e without bias</li>\r\n<li><strong>Scientific Processes: </strong>It establishes ways of investigating problems. These processes include:</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Observation</li>\r\n<li>Planning or designing the experiment</li>\r\n<li>Experimenting</li>\r\n<li>Prediction</li>\r\n<li>Measuring</li>\r\n<li>Classifying</li>\r\n<li>Collection</li>\r\n<li>Analysis or evaluation of data</li>\r\n<li>Asking insightful questions</li>\r\n<li>Inferring or drawing conclusion from data collected and analysed</li>\r\n<li>Building up concepts, principles, collected and analysis made</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>Scientific Products</strong>: Scientific Products are developed from the data, collected and analyzed. The analysis produces these products:</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Concepts which explain ideas specifically or generally</li>\r\n<li>Scientific principles which explain relationship of things e.g if water is exposed to the boiling point by heat, it produces vapour.</li>\r\n<li>Theory which is a_ group of principles explaining a_ natural phenomenon and _ predicting its behaviour.</li>\r\n<li>Laws which are universal truths established as a result of experimental findings. Generally, these scientific components can rightly or wrongly be applied. While trying to solve the society\'s problems and while trying to apply scientific attitudes, processes and products on human and environmental problems, care must be taken not to negatively injure the same life of the individual that we are trying to preserve or protect. Certain scientific activities which appeal superficially solvent and beneficial could have a long term or endemic negative consequences on human, non-human and environmental existence. A workable scientific method given the same conditions can be replicated anywhere any time without considering age, tribe or status. This is what is known as reliability of a true science. Any right scientific theory has universal principles which can be replicated under the same circumstances. There are basically two ways a verified and proven scientific and technological device can be applied while attempting to solve human, social and environmental problems. These two ways science and technology can be applied are: right application and wrong application.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<h4>Unit 3</h4>\r\n<h4>&nbsp;Right Application of Science</h4>\r\n<p>Generally, all researches and human activities are to better conditions of living and solving problem, all researches and human activities are to better conditions of living and solving problems Science devices findings and principles are applied to enhance chances of survival and development. Medical science or advancement in medicine, pharmacy and pharmacology when rightly applied can be used to save life and enhance quality of life. For instance, epidemiology which is a branch of medical science exposes diseases and ways they can be avoided prevented or treated.</p>\r\n<p>In anaesthesia and army om of lumps, mumps tissues becomes possible. Skin grafting and suturing of abrasion are performed to effect healing.

Just like most things that have positive and negative effects, science when wrong has chains of negative effects on human life and societal development.</p>\r\n<p>For instance, the excessive consumption of alcohol leads to <strong>Parkinson&rsquo;s disease </strong>excessive eating of food can lead to obesity and diabetes. Telecommunication and information gadgets can be used to track and trail e People&rsquo;s privacy, tap private discussion, spy on people, peep One\'s privacy, watch pornographic films, hack people\'s computes send threatening or unprintable massages, circulate false information propaganda, extort money from unsuspecting client, dupe, Cheat plan all manner of evils. In the field of medicine, the use of condom or contraceptives and abortifacients are wrongly applied to Promote promiscuity and abortion of unwanted pregnancies by uncommitted sexual partners.</p>\r\n<p>The production of arms has brought about the undesirable proliferation of arms which also has led to arms race (the craze to acquire arms by countries for mutual assaults and self-defense. Rather than use them to wage wars on avowed enemies, some disgruntled social frumps use it for robbery, thuggery and assassination. They are being used today globally by Self-proclaimed terrorist groups notably Aiquaeda in Afghanistan, Boko Haram in Nigeria, Cameroon, Niger and ethic insurgent groups who use such massive destructive weapons to harass, abduct, kidnap, assault and destroy jives and properties, Unfortunately too, the atomic energy Which scientifically has expanded global development is being used negatively to destroy lives, properties and pollute the environment. The issue of genetic engineering which is clearly demonstrated in human and animal cloning is one aspect of wrong application of science. Cloning stands contrary to all known and practiced religious doctrines. It tends to consciously cause unnatural mutation of the DeoxyriboNucleic Acid (DNA) the information carbon sheet or molecule in life. Its task is to produce identical copies of biological cell or gene (DNA). This biotechnology genetic engineering or gene cloning) makes it possible to produce the same human being in several numbers identical in all ramifications. In event of this, any of these human spares could be used for all manner of experiments like the guinea pigs. This aspect of science destroys human dignity and value. It destroyed the belief that every man is precious and unique which prevents the wasting of life because human life is irreplaceable.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Cloning or the Recombinant DNA techniques has even gone further to experiment on the possible fusion of genes of differing plants and those of animals and man to produce life which they believed God &ldquo;could not create or produce&rdquo; this has resulted in the production of monsters. Cloning technology has been misapplied to &mdash; challenge God, destroy religious and social morality and the basis for human existence. Through the effort of a Roman Catholic pontiff Pope St. John Paul 11, cloning received international condemnation and ban.</p>', 'JSS 1', 'Basic Science', '2021-10-13 03:26:00', '2021-10-13 03:26:00');

Dead trees are called wood. When wood has not been processed for use, it is typically referred to as Timber. The most important things about trees is that we do not only use them for our furniture and house construction but they provide us with the most important element in life. While the use carbon dioxide which we exhaust to manufacture their food, they give off oxygen which we need to live. So, it is important to have trees in our surroundings.</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>Growth of Timber: </strong>A tree grows by obtaining its food in the form of sap from the soil by suction through its roots. The sap contains moisture and minerals such as phosphate and nitrates. The sap is transported through the stem to the branches and leaves of a tree. The sap loses moisture through the leaves, absorbs carbon dioxide from the atmosphere by the process d photosynthesis, and becomes heaver. The dense sap later descends and gets deposited under the bark in the form of a thin layer known as cambium. The cambium hardens with, time and adds a new annual ring to that section of the stem. Annual rings show the number of years growth has occurred in a tree.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>Trees grow in two directions, vertical and horizontal. Vertical growth occurs near the tips of the shoot and root of the plant. Vertical growth starts at germination and continues throughout the life of the plant. it is known as primary growth, while horizon growth is called secondary grow Horizontal growth occurs mostly in the cambium. The cambium layer is in thin walled cells somewhere beneath the outer layer or skin of the young plant. The cambium divides to form plant two new layers of cells; wood cells on the inside, and bark cells on the outside of the cambium<strong>.</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<ol start=\"2\">\r\n<li><strong>Felling of Timber: </strong>Cutting down a tree is referred to as felling of timber. Timber is usually felled for one form of engineering work or the other. For timber to serve a useful purpose as an engineering material, certain factors need to be considered.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Age of the timber:</strong> Timber should be felled only if it mature. This is because under-mature has a large quantity of unused sap, while over-mature timber could develop a number of defects in the wood which is the inner part of tree. Defect reduce the quality of the timber.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Season the year: </strong>Should be felled during the dry season. This is because, in the dry season, the wood sap is reduced and is least active. Again, during the dry season the forest ground is firmer, and timber excavation from the forest.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Method of felling:</strong> Before timber is felled, the direction to which it will fall is determined. The stem is then cut, as near as possible to the ground to avoid waste. Chain saws are usually used in felling trees. A rope may be tied to the tree to pull it to whichever direction you want the tree to fall Only experienced persons should handle the task of timber felling to avoid an accident.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Conversion of Timber:</strong> Conversion is the process of cutting and sawing timber into commercial sizes. The tree trunk or stem is first cut into transportable sizes called logs. At the sawmill the log is converted (cut) into commercial (marketable) sizes such as boards and planks. The popular methods of conversion are plain-sawn and quarter ~ sawn.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>P<strong>lain-Sawn Method: </strong>In this method, the log is sawn plank after plank, without paying attention to the rays. The method is simple, quick and cheap. Hence, many prefer it.</li>\r\n<li>b<strong>. Quarter-Sawn Timber:</strong> This method involves converting the log into planks by cutting along the rays of the wood. The quarter-sawn method needs more attention than the plain-sawn method because the log has to be turned to align with the rays. The planks produced by this method have five figures. The converted timber is then stacked in the timber shed. Timber conversion should normally be done by experienced persons. Wastage of timber should be minimized and adequate allowance should be made for squaring, planning and, shrinkage when fixing the positions of the saw.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Seasoning of Timber:</strong> The process of reducing moisture or drying water content in timber is called seasoning. Freshly felled timber has a large amount of moisture or water content in the form of sap which makes it heavy. Such wet wood possesses low strength and cannot be used for any engineering work. Two methods of seasoning timber are natural or air seasoning and artificial seasoning.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong> Natural or Air Seasoning Method</strong> involves stacking planks one on top of the other with pieces of wood called stackers used to separate them. This stacking arrangement ensures that sufficient space is left around each Sawn piece and this allows for free Circulation of air. If need be, a heavy load is placed on the plank to prevent whipping (twisting). The stacked Quarter Sawn planks can either be in the open air or under a roof. Air drying takes several months. It is slow but simple and cheap.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong> Artificial Seasoning:</strong> This involves drying the wet timber through other means apart from natural air, Artificial seasoning can be done in the following ways; Water seasoning, boiling seasoning, Salt seasoning, kiln seasoning and electrical seasoning. Wood is usually seasoned artificially in order to reduce the length of time required for natural seasoning. It takes just few weeks to dry wood artificially, but it is more expensive. It demands closer supervision and reduces its strength.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<h5>Reasons for seasoning or drying</h5>\r\n<p>Timber is seasoned or dried for the following reasons;</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>It makes wood lighter in weight and therefore easier to transport.</li>\r\n<li>makes the wood stable for engineering work.</li>\r\n<li>It makes wood stronger.</li>\r\n<li>Seasoning makes wood durable because insects and fungi usually attack the starch in the wet sap wood.</li>\r\n<li>It makes wood preservatives more easily.</li>\r\n<li>It enables wood to be well polished.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<h4>Unit 2</h4>\r\n<h4>Properties of Good Timber Preservative</h4>\r\n<p>The following characteristics are desired in a good wood preservative.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>It must be able to remain in the wood for a very long period after it has been applied.</li>\r\n<li>It must be capable of rendering the wood completely poisonous to destructive organisms which feed on wood.</li>\r\n<li>it must not have any odour.</li>\r\n<li>In normal use, it should be incapable of inflicting injury on human beings, domestic animals or pets.</li>\r\n<li>It should be able to maintain its chemical composition for a long period.</li>\r\n<li>It is also desirable that a wood preservative be capable of good penetration into the wood,</li>\r\n<li>It should be capable of being simple and easily applied on wood.</li>\r\n<li>A good preservative should not have a damaging effect on the timber and be able to keep off fungi, insects and termites.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<h4>Unit 3</h4>\r\n<h4>Common Timber Defects</h4>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>A defect is anything present in wood, which results in the lowering of its quality or value. It can be natural or artificial.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>Natural Defects:</strong> Natural Defects are those, which occur in the growing tree and are usually manifested only after it has been felled. Some natural defects are;</li>\r\n<li><strong>Heart Shake:</strong> This is a split across the centre of a log, usually along a medullary ray.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Star Shake:</strong> This is different from the heart shake only by the fact that there are several splits, each along a medullary ray.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Cup Shake: </strong>This is a discontinuous split between two growth rings.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Ring Shake: </strong>A circular crack, which completely separated two annual rings.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Knot:</strong> This is a portion of a branch enclosed inside the stem of a tree.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>Artificial Defects: </strong>Artificial defects are those, which are caused by organisms or situations which are external to the growing tree or felled timber. These include;</li>\r\n<li><strong>Cup:</strong> This is a bend across the face of a plank.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Bow:</strong> This is a bend along the length of a plank.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Twist or Warp:</strong> This is a multiple bend about the axis of a plank.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Check:</strong> A split along the grain of wood.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Waney edge:</strong> This is the bark of tree showing on the edge of a Plank.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Dry root: </strong>This result when tiny organisms known as fungi destroy the wood.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Fungus Stain:</strong> Stain occurring on &gt; wood as a result of fungus attack.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Insect Attack:</strong> This result when termites and other insects live in the wood and steadily destroy it</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>Defects listed in numbers (i-iv) above are usually Caused by bad seasoning practices.</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>Shrinkage in -Timber:</strong> Seasoning causes timber to shrink.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>Some shrinkage occurs along the Circumference and this causes the growth rings to shorten. This is called <strong>circumferential shrinkage</strong>. Shrinkage also occurs longitudinally along the grain of wood thus shortening the length of the log. This is known as <strong>longitudinal shrinkage</strong>. Radial shrinkage also occurs from the bark towards the centre of the trunk. In terms of extent, usually the longitudinal shrinkage is the least while the circumferential shrinkage is the largest.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<h4>Unit 4</h4>\r\n<h4>Treatment and Timber Preservation Methods</h4>\r\n<p>Any special care or treatment given to wood or timber -amounts to its preservation. Because the sapwood of tees contains water food salts, air and warmth, wood is often attacked by fungi, termites, insects and other pestiferous organisms: Since usually contain varying amounts of these substances, the rate of attack differs with Wood type. This attack lowers the quality of wood and consequently reduces its service life. In order to preserve the service of life of wood, there is therefore a need to protect wood against an attack. Unlikely, this is done through any suitable method of wood perseveration. Wood preservation is the process of applying certain substances like chemicals to wood in order to protect it against attack by destructive organisms. like fungi, termites, insects etc, and therefore prolong its service life.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Preservation Methods:</strong> A substance which is applied to wood in order to prevent its deterioration and hence lengthen its service life is called a <strong>wood preservative</strong>. A wood preservative works essentially by making the food material in wood poisonous to the destructive agents.</p>\r\n<p>The three principal methods are:</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;Solvent Chemicals:</strong> The solvent type of chemicals need to be dissolved in liquids other than water so as to form solutions which then be applied on wood.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Water-bome Chemicals: </strong>The water-borne chemicals are dissolved in water to form the required solutions.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<strong>Tar Oils: </strong>A common example of tar oil is creosote; creosote is black and its often used to paint wooden electric and telephone poles.</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<h4>Unit 5</h4>\r\n<h4>Importance of Timber Treatment</h4>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The importance of timber treatment among others includes:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>It will prolong the service life of the timber or wood.</li>\r\n<li>It will make the timber to withstand or resist the destructive effects of fungi, bacteria, insects and termites attack an. timber.</li>\r\n<li>Timber treatment will position the timber to absorb paint, polish or any other chemicals that will enhance its. commercial value.</li>\r\n</ol>', 'JSS 1', 'Basic Science', '2021-10-13 03:40:40', '2021-10-13 03:40:40'),

It involves heating and melting iron ore in order to obtain the metals it contains.</p>\r\n<p>Many metals do not naturally exist in free state in the ground. They occur in association with other substances collectively referred to as impurities and the metals is referred to as the<strong> Ore.</strong> It is ore that is mined and processed so as to extract the required metal from the ore. It is this ore that is mined and processed so as to extract the required metal. Sometimes two or more metals exist together in the ore.</p>\r\n<p>Metals are divided into wo; ferrous and non-ferrous metal. <strong>Ferrous metals </strong>are those metals that have steel or iron in their composition while <strong>non-ferrous metals </strong>are those that have no steel or iron in their composition or formation. Non-ferrous metals are non-magnetic and anti-corrosive while ferrous metals are magnetic and can corrode or rust.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Processing of Ferrous Metals: </strong>After iron ore is dug up from the ground, it is transferred to a blast furnace and smelted. Smelting involves heating the ore until it turns to liquid. Unwanted elements such as silicon, manganese and others are extracted from the ore in this process. Thus, the blast furnace is simply is the device in which the ore is smelted and undesired elements burnt off. Before smelting, coke (a form of coal) and limestone are added to the iron ore.</p>\r\n<p>The mixture of iron ore, coke and limestone is <strong>charge.</strong> Smelting is achieved by forcing hot into the blast furnace. The unwanted elements and impurities are separated from the molten iron to form what is known as slag. This slag is removed. The molten iron is then transferred from the blast furnace and Cooled forming pig iron.</p>\r\n<p>The amount of carbon present in pig iron can be as high as 5%. This Carbon content is quite high for most Purposes of fabrication. Because of this relatively high carbon content of pig iron, it is very hard and difficult to be worked with tools. Consequently, pig iron is not very useful in technology. in order to render it useable, pig iron is converted to other forms of iron through the reduction of the percentage of carbon, which it contains. These forms of iron are discussed below.%%%%063%%%% <strong>Fig 2.1 A blast furnace</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<h4>Unit 2</h4>\r\n<h4>&nbsp;</h4>\r\n<h4>Forms of Iron from Pig Iron</h4>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>Casting</strong>: Is the process of melting metal into liquid and Pouring the liquid into moulds of different shapes so that when it cools ang becomes solid it takes the shape of the mould. This is the process used in the blast furnace. After removing the impurities by melting the iron ore in the furnace, the molten pig iron is collected in moulds<strong>.</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<ol start=\"3\">\r\n<li><strong>Cast iron:</strong> Cast iron is obtained when pig iron is put in a type of furnace called a cupola furnace. In this furnace, the carbon content is reduced to about 3.5%. The molten iron is then poured from the furnace into special containers called moulds, so as to solidify. This technique of pouring molten metal into moulds to solidify into a desired shape is casting, hence the name of the iron, cast iron. Cast iron is slightly more workable than pig iron. The various types of forms of cast iron is:</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Ductile cast iron.</li>\r\n<li>Malleable cast iron.</li>\r\n<li>Grey cast iron and</li>\r\n<li>White cast iron.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The latter two take their names from colours visible on their broken edges. Grey cast iron is more brittle than white cast Iron.</p>\r\n<ol start=\"2\">\r\n<li><strong>Steel: </strong>Steel is what is obtained when the carbon content of pig iron is reduced to 1.5% or less. Steel are named according to their carbon content. Thus, the different types are as follows;</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Low carbon steel (mild steel): This contains about 0.3% or less of carbon.</li>\r\n<li>Medium Carbon steel: This to about 0.5% carbon.</li>\r\n<li>High Carbon Steel: This has between 0.6% and 1.5% carbon. The above listed steels are solely made up of carbon and iron; as a result, they are called plain carbon steels. They are produced using the Bessemer converter or the open-hearth furnace. The Bessemer converter is a big, sturdy specially designed metal tank in which molten pig iron is poured. Hot air is forced into the Bessemer converter and this bums out the excess carbon contained in the pig iron. The open-hearth furnace makes use of solid pig iron, and this is melted together with steel scraps. Molten pig iron is later added to this mixture. Hot air forced into the furnace burns out unwanted carbon.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Alloy Steels:</strong> all Steels are alloys since they contain both iron and carbon. However, in a technical sense, the term alloy steel is used only for those steels, which contain other elements in addition to iron and carbon. Therefore, alloy steel is combination of plain carbon steel and one or more elements. The electric furnace is used for the production of alloy steels and other special purpose steels. The advantage of an electric furnace over a Bessemer converter and an open-hearth furnace is that it allows greater control to be exercised over the quality of steel to be produced.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>In order to produce alloy steel, plain carbon steel together with other elements needed are placed in the electric furnace and subsequently heated. All undesirable substances most notably, sulphur are burnt out of the molten mixture. This molten mixture is then poured into special container called mould and then cooled to solidify. Some examples of alloy steel are:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>High &mdash; tensile steels or nickel chrome alloys:</strong> These contain iron, carbon, nickel and chromium. They used for making machine Parts, which require high tensile strength.</li>\r\n<li><strong>High-speed Steels:</strong> These are made up of iron, carbon, tungsten and chromium. Certain forms contain cobalt and vanadium. High-speed steel maintains the same degree of sharpness of their cutting edges even when hot. Hence, they are much used as cutting edges in machines where friction causes excessive heat production due to continuous cutting.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Stainless Steels: </strong>These essentials are made up of iron, carbon, nickel or chromium. Nickel and chromium are principally used as coating for the metal so as to make it resistant to corrosion. Stainless steels are employed in part where staining is likely to occur if other steels are used. It should be noted that different types of steels may contain the same elements but in different proportions.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h5>Processing non-ferrous metals</h5>\r\n<p>The basic processes used in processing ferrous metals are also employed in the processing of non-ferrous metals. Some non-ferro metals are copper, aluminum, gold and thugsten. The ore is loaded into a furnace and melted. The desired metal in a molten state the separates from the mixture. The molten metal is then poured into containers so as to solidify. When done on large scale, reverberating furnace is used. When done on much smaller scale as in the neighborhood smiths, an earth furnace is used. Both types of furnaces are built of clay or other suitable earthen material.</p>', 'JSS 1', 'Basic Science', '2021-10-13 03:43:02', '2021-10-13 03:43:02'),
(22, 17, 'Chapter 17', 'Processing of Materials', '<h2>Topic 3</h2><br /><br /><h2>MATERIALS AND PROCESSING</h2><br /><h3>Topic: Clay, Ceramics and Glass</h3> <br />&nbsp;<h4>Unit 1</h4><br />&nbsp;Clay is excavated from the source where it is abundant. It cannot be used as raw because at that stage, it is still brittle due to some reasons among which are the air bubbles found in it.<br />Clay is then pressed by hand several times to make it pastry and remove the air bubbles and also stones and other unwanted materials. It can then be hand made to whatever material we want to form. Also, there is what we call potter&rsquo;s wheel which is used to form whatever material we need.<br />&nbsp;<br />Methods of processing clay.<br />In order to process ceramics, mud, clay is obtained and cleared of all plant material, stones, paper, metal, scraps, wooden pieces and other impurities. Afterwards, it is mixed with water and thoroughly poured until a smooth, even mixture is obtained. <br /><br />Next comes the shaping of this mixture into the desired object. This art of using earthen material to make various objects of earthenware, stoneware porcelain and others is known as pottery. A very useful tool in pottery is the potter\'s wheel. This device has a flat horizontal disc, which can be rotated. When in use, earthen material is placed on the disc and this disc is given a gentle spin. A potter then places his hands against the material to mould the desired object as the disc spins. <br />After shaping or moulding, the next process is baking or firing. Baking is done in a kiln or a fire. The objective of this process is to harden the moulded articles by heating them. Afterwards, the objects are allowed to cool gradually. They are now ready for use although a further process of decoration may be carried out on them before use. <br /><br />Some techniques of Decorating Pottery are:<br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Impressing and stamping.<br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;incising. <br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;carving <br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;piercing. <br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;slip decorating<br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;bumishing and polishing<br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;decorative glazing and <br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;painting. <br />The same basic processes are involved in the manufacture of high temperature bricks known as refractory bricks, red bricks, facing bricks, and others. Although, in this case, several types of machines are used since these are usually done on a fairly large scale. <br /><br />Methods of Processing Glass There are two types of glasses namely; <br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Inorganic or mineral glass, and <br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Organic or safety glass. <br />Inorganic glass is classified .as a ceramic while organic glass \'s usually classified as a plastic. Most glasses in use are of the inorganic type. Basically, inorganic glass is produced by melting together various proportions of silica (SiO2), soda ash (Sodium carbonate, Na2CO2), lime stone (Chalk, CaCos) and dolomite by firing them in a furnace. All these become a molten mixture which afterwards is very slowly cooled using a process annealing. Glass results from this. <br />Cooling process: Various shapes of glass are made by blowing air into the mixture while in its molten state. All these stages are undergone through the use of appropriate tools and equipment.</p>', 'JSS 1', 'Basic Science', '2021-10-13 03:49:17', '2021-10-13 03:49:17'),

There are numerous techniques or methods for producing plastic objects. Some of these are blow moulding, injection moulding, rotational moulding, thermoset moulding, thermoforming, tube, film and sheet extrusion, casting, laminating, calendaring and framed plastics production. Generally, moulding methods involve forcing heated and molten plastic material into a mould which has been | made into the desired shape of the object. A cooling process is used while the plastic material is still in the mould to ensure that the desired shape is retained.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>Plastic pipes, hoses, and tubes, because of their desired flexibility are usually made of thermoplastic materials and are produced using the technique called extrusion. Extrusion involves feeding plastic granules into a heating chamber where it is turned into liquid. This liquid is then passed into the extrusion mould where forced cooling causes it to solidify. Thermoplastic sheets are usually made using the method called <strong>calendaring</strong>. In this case, plastic material is heated until it becomes a paste. This paste is then passed through a series of rollers, which flatten the paste into large sheets o required thickness. In the vast majority of plastic production techniques, air or water is used for the cooling process.</p>\r\n<ol start=\"2\">\r\n<li><strong>Rubber: Natural rubber and synthetic rubber </strong>are the two Classes &lsquo;of rubber currently available. Natural rubber is obtained from latex. Latex is a milky fluid which is found under the bark of many tropical trees. However, the free almost exclusively used for commercial Production of latex is the para-rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis).</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>The technique of processing. natural rubber begins by tapping a rubber tree for its latex. Tapping is done by cutting at several points along the erect stem, Narrow channels running for about half the circumference of a tree trunk. These channels are made in a Spiraling manner container into which latex runs are positioned at the outlets of the channels.</p>\r\n<p>After collection, the latex is sieved to remove solid impurities and then mixed with water. Next, the rubber is made to coagulate (thicken) out of the latex by the addition of dilute acetic or formic acid; and they are deposited on aluminum partitions in horizontal tanks. These partitions allow the rubber to be formed as slabs rather than in a single lump. This makes handling easier. The rubber may be further treated into any grade desired. Some grades of natural rubber are pale creep, smoked sheet and skim rubber.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Synthetic Rubber </strong>is processed from organic compounds derived from petroleum. Petroleum is mined from the ground either on land or underneath the sea. There are several synthetic rubbers and they are usually preferred to natural rubbers for certain specialized purposes for example some are more resistant to oil (e.g. acrylonitrile rubber), much less permeable to air (e.g. butyl rubber) and withstand higher temperatures (e.g. silicone rubber) than natural rubber. Some other synthetic rubbers are butadiene, polyisoprene, polysulfide ethylene &mdash;propylene, and vedox.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h4>Unit 3</h4>\r\n<h4>Uses of rubber and rubber plastics&nbsp;</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>it is used for chairs and tables in our homes and offices.</li>\r\n<li>It is used as container bags in super markets and as a pure water Ceiling Container</li>\r\n<li>It is used in engines of cars where intense heat is not needed.</li>\r\n<li>It is used where heat is not experienced like the rotor etc.</li>\r\n<li>It is used as body fender for cars of recent.</li>\r\n<li>It is used as body parts for most of our musical instruments, piano, flutes, speakers etc</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h5>Rubber</h5>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Rubber is used as shock absorber in our vehicles.</li>\r\n<li>It is used to absorb sound.</li>\r\n<li>It is used to absorb light. iv. ft is used to carry the engine of motor car and other heavy weight.</li>\r\n</ul>', 'JSS 1', 'Basic Science', '2021-10-13 03:59:18', '2021-10-13 03:59:18'),

It shows all the details of an object and hence are the most useful of all technical drawings. They are indispensable in the final stages of design of an object or structure. They are the only drawings upon which fabrication or construction of objects, machines and structures can be based unlike pictorial drawings. Orthographic drawings do not show objects the way they will appear when viewed by the eye. They rather show how an object will appear when viewed one face at a time. Thus, interpretation of orthographic drawings can be made only by someone trained in it. Orthographic drawing is the best way of representing an object on a plane surface. In this method of representation, different views of the object are drawn separately, but they are all arranged at right angles to one another on the paper Although tt takes more time and may seem more difficult to draw than the pictorial drawings, orthographic drawings however have the following advantages;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h4>Unit 2</h4>\r\n<h4>Advantages of Orthographic Projections</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Each view shows visible and hidden views. The combination of two or more views gives a precise idea of the object.</li>\r\n<li>Circles, area, and lines appear on &lsquo;he drawings exactly as they are on the object.</li>\r\n<li>When pictorial, drawings can show a maximum of three Views of an object, orthographic&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>Also, whereas the three views of an object must be drawn in order to understand a pictorial drawing, in many cases, just two views of an orthographic drawings typically contain three views.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h4>Unit 3</h4>\r\n<h4>&nbsp;Principal planes of projection&nbsp;</h4>\r\n<p>When constructing an orthographic drawing, lines are imagined as being drawn (or Projected) from the object to three mutually perpendicular surfaces called horizontal plane, can be better understood by thinking of them as the remaining sides of cuboids, which has had its top and two from adjacent sides removed.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h5>&nbsp;Angles of Projection</h5>\r\n<p>When constructing an orthographic drawing, it is necessary to specify the angle of projection which is being used. expression, angle of projection refers to the quadrant of a circle in which the object being drawn is imagined to be placed. A quadrant is the fourth part of a circle. Suppose the vertical plane and horizontal plane intersect, four quadrants are produced. The quadrants covering 0&deg; to 90&deg;, 91&deg; to 180&deg;, 181&deg; to 270&deg;, and 271&deg; to 360&deg; are respectively called first, second, third, and fourth angles. Of these four angles, only two are used as angles of projection in technical drawing. These are the first angle, and the third angle.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h4>Unit 4</h4>\r\n<h4>&nbsp;Principal Views</h4>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Front elevation, side elevation and plan. The drawing of an object when viewed from the principal horizontal plane is called the plan. If the object is drawn when viewed from the principal vertical plane, the front elevation is obtained. if the object is drawn when viewed from the principal profile plane, the end elevation is obtained.</p>\r\n<h5>Dimensioning Technique</h5>\r\n<p>Any standard drawing, no matter how it has been made, is not complete if it lacks appropriate dimensions. Dimensioning starts with the preliminary stages design and continues to the final stages of design and also spills over into the construction stage, following points should be followed so as to properly dimension drawings.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>A small gap should be allowed between the outline of an object and the start of a projection line.</li>\r\n<li>The projection line should stop a short distance after the arrow tip.</li>\r\n<li>Extremes of dimensions should be placed furthest from the object Shorter dimensions should be placed closer to the outlines but not closer than 5mm a way.</li>\r\n<li>Dimension should be properly spaced out, etc.</li>\r\n</ol>', 'JSS 1', 'Basic Science', '2021-10-13 05:32:42', '2021-10-13 05:32:42'),

Perspective Drawing</h4>\r\n<p>Perspective drawings are pictorial drawings which show three sides of objects at once. Of all pictorial drawings, perspective drawings are the closest to how the eye actually sees objects. Their principal distinguishing feature is that they make allowance for the fact that as an object receives from the eye, the image of it observed by the eye becomes smaller. This is easily observed in the case of very tall structures or long walls standing on the ground and looking up, the observer notices that the image of the structure gradually becomes smaller and converges to a vanishing point. Any portion of the structure beyond this vanishing point is compressed and not readily observable.</p>\r\n<h4>Unit 2</h4>\r\n<h4>Measuring and Comparing Given Sizes</h4>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>There are two measuring scales used in making drawings. These are architects scale and the. engineers scale. The architect scale is divided into units or fractions such as found on a standard rule. It is used in marking workings or drawings for the mechanic and the building. The engineers scale is divided into decimal units&rsquo; that is 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 80 and 100 parts to an inch. It is used in map drawing.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h5>Architect\'s Scale</h5>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Examine your scale and study the various graduations. On one edge you will find that the graduations are like those of a common rule. On the adjoining edge, the graduations are marked 1&frac12; at one end and 3 at the opposite end. Observe that the first large space at each end is divided into units like those of the common rule. For example, at one end the first three-inch division is marked to represent a standard rule. But the graduations are much smaller, the three-inch division represents one foot and one of its twelve quarter-inch graduations represents one - inch.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Continue to tum the scale and observe that the edges are marked into divisions of 1 and 1&frac12;, 3/4&rdquo; and 3/8&rdquo;, Ys\" and 1/8\", 3/16&rdquo; and 3/32&rdquo;. At each end of the scale, the first division is marked off to represent the graduations of a common rule.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The special divisions on each edge of the scale are making drawings smaller than full size and in proportion. if you wish to make a drawing quarter size or three inches to the foot, you would choose the division marked 3 and imagine that each â…” is one inch and proceed to draw.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The Engineer\'s scale is marked to represent feet and inches, but the graduations are in decimals rather than in fractions. This scale differed from the architect\'s scale in that the smaller divisions of an inch, such as appear at each end of the architect\'s scale, appear along its full length.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<h4>Unit 4</h4>\r\n<h4>&nbsp;Scale Drawing</h4>\r\n<p>There are three ways of specifying scales on a drawing. They are,</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>Full-Size Scale:</strong> If the size of an object is neither big nor small to be contained on drawing sheet, the full-size scale will be drawn, the scale ratio is 1:1, etc. 1mm drawn on the drawing sheet represents the same1mm on the actual scale.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Reduction (decreasing) size Scale:</strong> If the object is bigger then, the size of the drawing paper, the size (dimension) has to be reduced to be convenient for the size of the drawing paper e.g Ratios 1:2 1:5 1:10, 1:50 and 1:100 etc if ration 1:10 is used, it implies that 1mm on&nbsp; the paper represents 10mm on the actual objects.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Enlargement (Increasing) size Scale:</strong> If the object 1s too small than the size of the drawing paper the size (dimension) has to be increased to be convenient for the size of the drawing paper e.g 5:1 10:1, 100:1, 2:1 3:1, etc If ratio 100:1 is used this indicates that 100mm on the. drawing paper represents 1mm on the object.</li>\r\n</ol>', 'JSS 1', 'Basic Science', '2021-10-13 05:35:10', '2021-10-13 05:35:10');

Its principal function is to prevent unrestricted access to an enclosed space. A door way consists of a movable slab, which is called leaf, and the frame to which it is attached. A door may be made of wood, metal, glass or any other solid material or their combinations. The door may be opaque as to prevent see-through vision, translucent as to permit the passage of light or transparent as to permit seeing through it.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>Doors are grouped in two ways in accordance with the type of material they are made of and the manner. in which they are operated. There are different types under each group. Among those grouped according to materials, that have the wooden doors to be its commonest type used in residential houses. These may take the form of solid carved and beautifully decorated slabs or rectangular frames covered on both sides with sheets of plywood.</p>\r\n<p>Glass doors are largely used in shops, supermarkets, hotels, and other such places where impression of elegance is to be decorated.</p>\r\n<p>Transparent glass doors are beautifully used in architecture in order to create interior lighting effects in buildings. Metal doors find much use in buildings where considerate security is needed such as in banks and prisons, they almost exclusively take the form of heavy steel slabs welded to strong frames. Metal doors are also increasingly being used in homes. Doors grouped according to the manner in which they are operated are more varied.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h5>The common Types in this Group are the following:</h5>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>Pivoted or Hinged Door:</strong> The pivoted or hinged door is the most predominant. In this case, the leaf is hinged on one side of the frame and this may be the left, right, or top post. Usually, the length can be hinged between 90&deg; and 180&deg; tum about the post. A pivoted door may be installed vertically or inclined in a wall, or horizontally in a floor. Some pivoted doors set in large openings have leaves hinged on opposite sides of the frame.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Sliding Door: </strong>Sliding door move horizontally along grooves. some cases, they are supported rollers so that they glide easily al their grooves.

Most windows are covered Casement with translucent materials or transparent materials. In which case, the window whether closed or open admits light through itself. Transparent materials further permit see-through vision. Such materials are mostly glass or special plastics. Some windows are also covered with Opaque materials such as wood or metal. In this case, the windows can only perform their functions when they are open. There are some windows designed to be normally closed. These ones serve only the purpose of illumination, the use of such windows is limited to air-conditioned spaces. Windows which can be opened perform the function of ventilation. Stained glass windows for creating colour effects are also used in churches, museums, and others. A typical window consists of a number of parts. The casing is the frame in which the window Is set. The sides of the casing are called jambs, A sill and a lintel are respectively located at the bottom and top of slanting members. The movable part of window is called <strong>sash. </strong>There is a wide variety of materials such as timber, glass, metal or combination of materials used on buildings. Some of them are more common than the others. Among the common ones are following:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>Casement Windows: </strong>A casement window has one or more sashes pivoted on jambs about which they can rotate. Casement window operates much like hinged doors.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Louvered Window:</strong> A louvered window A window is made up of a number of horizontal glass panes called louvers fixed to pivots.

(33, 23, 'Chapter 23', 'Soldering and Brazing', '<h2>Topic 9</h2>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<h3>&nbsp;TOOLS, MACHINES AND PROCESSES</h3>\r\n<h3>Topic: Soldering and Brazing</h3>\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n<h3>Introduction</h3>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In metal work, metal joining is a very important aspect of metal work practice. It is hardly possible to fabricate a metallic object without the need to join metal pieces. Hence there are various methods of doing so. Soldering and brazing are some of the methods used for joining metals quickly.</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<h4>Unit 1</h4>\r\n<h4>&nbsp;</h4>\r\n<h4>Meaning of Soldering, Brazing and Methods of joining Metals</h4>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>There are five principal methods of joining metals. These are:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Soldering</li>\r\n<li></li>\r\n<li>Welding</li>\r\n<li>Riveting</li>\r\n<li>Bolts and Nuts.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Soldering, brazing, welding, and riveting are permanent methods. That is to say that metal pieces joined by any of these four methods cannot be Separated without the risk of damage. The first method allows dissembling anytime it is desired. The first three methods mentioned above can only be brought about through the application of heat, but the other two methods are carried out at normal temperatures. When properly done, ail these five methods produce very strong joints.</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<h5>Meaning of Soldering&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h5>\r\n<p>Soldering is a process whereby a material known as solder is melted between two metallic surfaces so as to join them together. This solder is a metal alloy whose melting point is lower than the melting points of the metals to be joined.</p>\r\n<p>There are Two Types of Soldering, Namely; Soft Soldering and Hard Soldering. The principal distinguishing feature between the two of them is that the former occurs at temperatures much lower than those of them are Carried out at temperatures, which are not above 425&deg;C. Furthermore, joints &lsquo;produced through hard soldering are much stronger than those produced through soft soldering.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Soft solders are largely alloys of tin and lead</strong>. Their strengths depend on the relative percentages of these two elements. Most hard solders are alloys of mainly silver, with copper and zinc added. Materials such as antimony, bismuth, and cadmium are added to solders so as to obtain. certain desirable properties.</p>\r\n<p>Several non-ferrous materials, for example silver, lead, copper, brass, tin, gold, are readily soldered. Ferrous metals such as steels and irons are however not easily soldered.</p>\r\n<h5>Meaning of Brazing</h5>\r\n<p>Although brazing is a distinct metal joining process, it is similar to soldering. The principal difference between brazing and soldering is that the former takes place at temperature higher than 425&deg;C while the latter takes place at lower temperature.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Brazing involves Melting a nonferrous filler</strong> metal at the point contact of two metallic surfaces order to join them. This filer must have a melting point lower than the melting points of metals to be joined. The metals being joined are not melted during brazing. Brazing is particularly useful in joining dissimilar metals as well as metals which are difficult to weld. It produces very strong joints which is skillfully done, the finishing usually, is attractive and neat.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h5>There are Three Common Types of Brazing</h5>\r\n<p>Each one takes its name from the filles metal used. There is <strong>copper brazing, silver brazing and aluminium brazing.</strong> The first makes 4 use of alloys of copper and it is done at temperatures ranging from 109&deg;C to 7 1150&deg;C. The second takes place at, temperatures ranging. from 63&deg;C to. 84&deg;C and it makes use of alloys of: silver such as silver zinc and silver! brass. The last, which makes use of: aluminium-boron and aluminium-nickel takes place at temperatures of 57&deg;C to 64&deg;C</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h4>&nbsp;Unit 2</h4>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>Soldering tools</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>&nbsp;There are three essential soldering tools. These are the following:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Heat Source</li>\r\n<li>Solder, and\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Flux</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Apart from these, there is a need for a stationary surface upon which the metals to be joined, or the job being worked upon are placed. A workshop table fills this need. There is a number of devices used for producing heat needed for soldering. Typical among these are the soldering iron, the flame heater, the gas torch, and the heated pot.</p>\r\n<p>The soldering iron operates on the principle of the joule heat. When electricity is fed into it, heat develops in its heating element and this is applied to the solder through its top. The eldering iron is useful for heating light such as electrical terminals and in sheet metal joints. The soldering iron is not suitable for heavy work. The name heater makes use of electricity to generate heat.</p>\r\n<p>The gas torch produces heat by burning a mixture of a combustible gas air. It has a regulating device for controlling the flame emitted at its nozzle. When being used, its flame is directed at the solder placed on the gap between the surfaces to be joined. The solder melts and fills the gap. The heated pot takes the form of a bow in which solder is placed. Heat applied to the bow melts the solder. The joint to be soldered is then introduced into the molten solder and allowed to remain&rsquo; there for a short time interval. After the time interval, the joint is lifted from the pot and allowed to cool. The solder hardens forming a strong joint.</p>\r\n<p>Solders are made in various forms. Some of these forms are coiled wire, long thread, straight wire, bars, sheets, and pastes. The choice of a suitable form depends on the technique of soldering and the kind of job to be done.</p>\r\n<p>Fluxes are made in form of paste or powder. Also, they are available in wire form wherein they are made as the interior core of solder-flux combinations.</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>Brazing Tools </strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>The equipment essential to brazing comprises the following: (a) Heat source. (b) Filter metal, and (c) Flux</p>\r\n<p>There are several devices through which heat can be supplied for the purpose of brazing. Some of these are gas torch, electric heater, furnace, and heated bowl. A gas torch burns a mixture of a combustible gas and air, thus, producing a flame which is directed at the joint being brazed. This is a manual method for brazing fairly small metallic parts. Heating in a furnace is used whenever particularly high temperatures are required or there is a need to braze under controlled conditions. The heated bow is used whenever there is a need to dip the joint inside the melted filler metal. This method is employed in manufacturing machine components.</p>\r\n<p>The filler metal is made in form of wires, rods, rings, and plates. It may also be manufactured to conform to specified shapes. Filler metals are alloys of copper, silver, or aluminum. Brazing fluxes exist in the form of powders, or pastes. Zinc chloride and ammonium chloride are common fluxes.</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<h4>Unit 3</h4>\r\n<h4>Operations, Types and Uses</h4>\r\n<p><strong>Soldering is accomplished by taking the following steps:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The metal surfaces to be joined should be thoroughly cleaned of and such impediments.</li>\r\n<li>chemical solvent, steel wool, or emery paper can be used for this purpose. If this step is not undertaken, the Solder will not be able to adhere strong to the surfaces.</li>\r\n<li>The solder to be used should have a chemical called flux applied surfaces. Flux dissolves any oxides present on the surfaces being joined, prevents oxidation during heating, and improves the following ability of the solder after melting. Zinc chloride and ammonium chloride fluxes are common, the former being used mainly for copper alloys. For soldering electrical connection and &lsquo;electronic circuits, a non-corrosive flux, for example, rosin is used.</li>\r\n<li>The surfaces to be soldered should be set, such that a gap of 4 function of a millimeter should between them. Feed the solder to the gap and apply heat on the solder to the gap and apply heat on the solder at the gap so that the solder melts and fills the gap. The solder wets the surfaces and penetrates the gap.</li>\r\n<li>The soldered joint should be kept motionless and allowed to cool. At it cools, the melted solder hardens and rigidly binds the surfaces.</li>\r\n<li>Use a wire brush to clean off flu residues at the soldered joint.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Brazing operation:</strong> The first step in brazing is to thoroughly clean the surfaces to be joined. After cleaning the surfaces are then set such that gap of a fraction of a millimeter exists between them. Next, a filler metal is placed at the joint which is to be brazed. The filler metal ought to be coated with a brazing flux. The flux prevents oxidation on the surfaces to be joined and also makes the filler metal to flow more readily when it is melted. The heat is applied at the joint. The filler metal melts, wets the surfaces and fills the tiny gap. As the filler metal cools, it hardens, thus forming a strong joint.</p>', 'JSS 1', 'Basic Science', '2021-10-13 08:35:39', '2021-10-13 08:35:39'),

(35, 25, 'Chapter 25', 'Rotary Motion', '<h2>Topic 11</h2>\r\n<h3>Tools, Machines and Processes</h3>\r\n<h3>Topic: Rotary Motion</h3>\r\n<h4>Unit 1</h4>\r\n<h4>&nbsp;</h4>\r\n<h4>Meaning of Rotary Motion&nbsp;</h4>\r\n<p>When a body moves in such a way that all the points on it, spin about a fixed axis, its motion is described as rotary. In other words, rotary is a motion about a fixed centre of rotation largely used in machines and engines. In rotary motion, the particles of the body move along concentric paths. However, the body itself does not alter its location. Another name by which rotary motion is known is rotational motion.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h5>There are different types of rotary motion. Some of these are following:</h5>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>One-way motion: </strong>one-way rotation is characterized by the spinning continuously in one direction. Examples of these are the crank shaft of a running engine, the shaft of ap electric motor, the armature winding of an electric generator, so on.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Reversible Rotary Motion</strong>: <strong>A</strong>nother type of rotary motion is the reversible rotary motion. In this case, the clockwise movement of the rotating shaft is immediately followed by an anti-clockwise movement. This process may be continuous as in the case of a motor vehicle windscreen wiper or intermittent as in the case of a door handle. The rotating handle by which a vehicle window is controlled is also an example of an object which undergoes a reversible rotary motion.</li>\r\n<li><strong>One</strong>-<strong>way intermittent Rotary Motion: </strong>The third type is the one-way intermittent rotary motion. In this case, the rotation is interrupted at specific time intervals.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>An example of this is the second is indicator on an analogy watch or clock. The indicator rotates but stops for slight seconds along its path.</p>\r\n<p>The non-return rotary motion is employed in racket mechanisms found on workshop tools, vehicle handbrakes etc. This type of rotary motion is characterized by the object being locked in position so that an oppositely directed motion is impossible. Brake pedals, door knobs, throttles, cork screws, kitchen tin cutters, control knobs on electric gadgets, wheels, etc are other examples of objects in which rotation is beneficially applied.</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>Load drum of a cane</strong>: A crane is used for lifting or lowering heavy loads as may be required. The crane is designed to make use of lifting rope. Arrangements are made to wine the rope on a drum for lifting and unwinding it to lower the load. That is, the drum can rote in either clockwise or anti-clockwise direction. Devices are provided on the crane to facilitate staring or stopping the drum whenever it&rsquo;s necessary.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Brakes</strong>: The primary function of brakes is to control motion. First, by slowing down the motion and bringing the motion to a stop if necessary. There are many types of brakes in use brakes, but we shall discuss motor car brakes. The effective friction to stop the car is obtained by pressing stationery shoes or pads against its rotating member. Hydraulic system is common employed for this purpose. This involves pressurizing brake fluid to operate the pad in disc brakes and shoes.</li>\r\n<li>Operation of the brakes is initiated from the driver by pressing the brake pedal which operates the hydraulic system. For the rotating drum brakes, as the shoes which press against the drum are actuated by the wheel cylinders when the pedal is operated. As soon as the pedal is depressed, the shoes are returned to their original position by the springs and the road wheels are released. For this disc brakes, when the driver operates the brake pedal, the pads will grip the disc by the action of the pistons fixed rate behind the pads. The brakes are released as soon as the brake pedal is g depressed.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Clutches: </strong>Power transmission, it is often necessary to be able to interrupt the driver without reducing the speed of the prime mover. For example, when changing motor car, the engine does not have to be stopped nor do we have to stop the machine when examining a work piece on the lathe. The function of a clutch is to interrupt the motion from one shaft to another in power transmission line. There are many types of clutches; a dog clutch and a friction clutch. We shall discuss about friction clutches which are used in motor cars. The dog clutch is not suitable for cars because the connection of a rotating engine to a stationery transmission shall will not only damage the transmission but also jolt the car violently.</li>\r\n<li>The friction clutch takes up the drive smoothly and also disengages the drive when required.</li>\r\n<li>Disc is connected to the engine while disc b\" is connected to the transmission. When the discs are in motor cars. The dog clutch is not separated, no drive is affected.1 suitable for motor car because the soon as the discs are in contact, the connection of a rotating engine to transmission line. The application jolt the car violently. The friction force controls the drive and this can be varied accordingly to obtain a smooth take-off.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Ratchets: </strong>A ratchet is a set of teeth arranged at the edge of a bar or name wheel with pawl to ensure motion usually in one direction only. It mainly used for intermittent motion.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<h4>Unit 2</h4>\r\n<h4>Principle of Application</h4>\r\n<p>There are two principle types motion namely: Linear Motion and Rotary Motion. Generally, motion is governed by certain physical laws called Newton\'s Law of motion. There are three of such laws.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Newton\'s first law:</strong> The first states that a body which is at rest or moving at a constant velocity will continue to remain at rest or move at its constant velocity unless it is acted upon by a force, in which case it will act otherwise. This law is otherwise known as the law of <strong>INERTIA</strong>. Inertia is the property of matter, which makes it to maintain an in changing state of rest, or state the motion Inertia depends on the mass of object. The larger the mass, the larger in the inertia. This means that it will be easier to change the velocity of a light object that of a heavy object. A passenger standing inside a bus is an -example of the application of newton&rsquo;s first law of motion. Wherever the bus starts moving or accelerates suddenly, the passenger fall backward, in trying to remain at rest. If however the bus stops moving or decelerates suddenly, the passenger fails forward in trying to continue moving.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Newton&rsquo;s Second Law:</strong> Newton\'s Second law states that the force coming motion on a body is directly proportion d to the mas and acceleration of the body for a Constant mass a large force will result in a larger acceleration. For a Constant force, the larger the mass, the smaller the acceleration. An application of the second law is that the effect of a force is always in the direction of the force. for example, if you punch an ae away from you, assuming no other forces are involved, they should move away from you.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Newton&rsquo;s Third Law:</strong> The third law states that when one body exerts a force or another body, this other body also exerts an equal by oppositely directed force on the first body. This implies that reaction Is always equal and opposite to action. The third law has many practical applications. Some of these are the balloon, rocket engine, and jet engine. In each case, air or gas rushing out \'of nozzles causes a reaction which punches the object in an opposite direction. An application of the third law is that of a raffle, which recoils after a bullet is fired.</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<h4>Unit 3</h4>\r\n<h4>Conversion of Rotary Motion to Linear Motion.</h4>\r\n<p>The electric motor and the internal combustion engine (IC) are the two most important deices for producing motion. However, the kind of motion produced by these two devices is rotary motion is quite useful but there are instances when linear motion is desired. Because of this a number of mechanisms through which rotary motion is converted into linear motion have been invented. Some of these mechanisms are rack and pinion, screws, crank and piston, cams and eccentrics. through the appropriate combination of one or more of these mechanisms, various types of machine tools are able to convert rotary motion produced by the electric motors into useful linear motion. A number of these mechanisms have been taught earlier in this course. Currently, we are considering them within the context of changing a type of motion to another.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>Rack and Pinion:</strong> A rack and pinion consists of a flat bar called rack in contact with a wheel called pinion. Both of them have teeth which are designed to mesh with themselves. When used, it is the pinion that is attached to the power source, such as the shaft of a motor or internal combustion. As the pinion rotates, its teeth put those of thee rack. The result is that the rack moves linearly. In some manual machines, the pinion is driven by means of a handle attached to it. An example of this is the work table of a drilling machine, which is raised or lowered through a rack and pinion mechanism. %%%%065%%%%<strong>Fig 11.1 Rack and pinion</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ol start=\"2\">\r\n<li><strong>Screw:</strong> A screw usually takes the form of a round rod having a spinal thread along its outer surface. It has a specially shaped head by which it is driven through the use of an appropriate screw driver. When being fastened or fastened, the screw rotates about its axis and by so doing moves linearly along the same axis. The anger bit and drilling bit also operate on the basic working principle of screws.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<ol start=\"3\">\r\n<li><strong>Crank and Slider:</strong> The Crank and Sider Consists of a rotating disk or plate called crank connected by a rod to a linearly moving block called slider. As the crank rotates, the slider is moved forward and backward within a slot or other suitable constraint. %%%%067%%%%<strong>Fig 11.2 Screw</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<ol start=\"4\">\r\n<li><strong>Crank, Connecting Rod, and Piston:</strong> This is an application of the crank and slider. It is used in internal combustion engine. In this case, the crank takes the form of a crankshaft and the piston represents the slider. The connecting rod is attached to the crankshaft at one end and the piston at the other. The piston moves within a cylinder which stands for the constraint along which a slider moves. Depending on the kind of engine, there may be four or six cylinders.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>In an internal combustion (IC) engine cylinder, it is linear motion which is converted to rotary motion and not the reverse. Expanding gases produced by the combustion of fuel and air in the cylinder push the pistons up down continuously. This linear motion is transmitted to the crankshaft, which consequently rotates. In a motor car, the rotary motion, of the crankshaft is passed on to the transmission System which is ultimately connected to the wheels.%%%%069%%%% <strong>Fig 11.3 crank and slider</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<ol start=\"5\">\r\n<li><strong>Cam:</strong> A Cam is a device so shaped that it is round on one side and oblong on the other side. One common use of cams is the opening and closing of valves. In such an instance, a valve cover is held against the cam by means of a spring. As the cam rotates, the valve cover is pushed forward and backwards repeatedly. A cam may be used singly or used in combination as is the case with the camshaft of 1.C engines. %%%%071%%%%<strong>Fig 11.4 A crank and pinion</strong></li>\r\n<li><strong>Eccentrics: </strong>Eccentrics are devices having peculiar shapes needed to transmit motion in some desirable manner. In a true sense, an eccentric object consists of various, shapes combined. An eccentric normally is connected to a source of motion. As the eccentric moves, &amp; pushes against another machine component. The uneven shape of the: eccentric causes the machine component to move in an irregular manner.</li>\r\n</ol>', 'JSS 1', 'Basic Science', '2021-10-13 08:40:59', '2021-10-13 08:40:59'),

The first hockey cub was inaugurated in 1849 at Blackheath in Southeast London. Field hockey is played by both men and women. Men\'s field hockey has been played.at each Summer Olympic Games since 1908, while women\'s field hockey joined in 1980.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h4>Unit 2</h4>\r\n<h4>Facilities and Equipment</h4>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The game Is played on a rectangular field that measures 90m long and 54m wide. The length is called the sideline while the width is called the goal line. The centre line cuts the field (widthway) into two equal halves, these two halves are further divided into two equal parts by the 22 5m lines giving rise to four equal parts of the field 225m. Two goal posts at the middle of the goal lines are constructed. There is also the sinking circle constructed from each of the upright posts of the goal mouth using a radius of 14. 67m.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The striking circle is very important in several ways in the game of field hockey They include.</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>It is the only area where the goalkeeper is allowed to stop the ball with any part of the body including the hands.</li>\r\n<li>The is the only area where he can kick the ball with hie legs</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>All players stand outside the striking circle when a penalty corner is taken. The same is applicable when penalty stroke and penalty bully are awarded.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h5>Hockey Field</h5>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>Hockey Sticks </strong>The game of hockey is played with sticks that have the shape of the letter (J) The striking side of the stick is usually flat with a tapering handle which Is tightly bound with adhesive tape All hockey sticks are right-handed with a weight of 642 grams.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Hockey Ball</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>The ball is a round object bigger and heavier than the tennis ball it has a white leather covering with a weight of 156gm and a circumference of 24 13cm. It can bounce much as a lawn tennis ball. However, snow hockey ball is completely</p>\r\n<ol start=\"3\">\r\n<li><strong>Uniform</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>The attire is normal jersey and boots without iron studs. However, the goalkeeper wears a long sleeve polo, a broad shin guard that spans from the feet to a little bit above the knee and a pair of bats.</p>\r\n<p>The goal mouth is made up of two upright posts, could be of wood or iron of about 2.13m high and a crossbar about 3.66m. These make up the go mouth plus the net and 35cm wide back board which goes round t back area of the goal mouth.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h5>Unit 3 Basic skills in Hockey</h5>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>There are basically four elementary skills in the game of hockey.

Another example is in dribbling; movements such as footwork, body movement, etc are embodied in dribbling.</p>\r\n<h5>Explanation of the main skills</h5>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>&nbsp;<strong>Hit</strong> This means striking the ball with the flat surface of the stick. To make a good distance in this skill, the hockey stick is gripped with both hands on the handle in astride position. The stick is thrown backwards but not above the Shoulder level. in a split second the Stick is lowered to hit the ball on the ground to where it is expected to go.</li>\r\n<li>&nbsp;<strong>The Stop</strong> This means banging a moving or travelling ball to a halt using the flat Surface of the hockey stick. Usually the right hand is lowered towards the neck of the stick for effective Stopping.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Dribbling</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>This is moving the ball with short \" &lsquo;pushes using the stick, into the opponent\'s half of the field Sometimes long pushes are necessary provided they are within the control of the player.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ol start=\"4\">\r\n<li><strong>Passing:</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>This involves striking or pushing the ball to a teammate for the purpose of gaining advantage over the opponent.

The game was a popular sport during the Roman. Empire but theirs was boxing till either of the opponents dropped dead. da The sport was originally male to dominated but in recent times females are occasionally seen in the ring. The first documented account of a bar- knuckle fight in England was in 1681 in London protestant mercury, which produced James Figg as champion. There were no written rules, no woot divisions, no referee and no round limits.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Basic Technique. </strong></p>\r\n<p>These include the following</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Stance</li>\r\n<li></li>\r\n<li></li>\r\n<li>Cross &mdash; (right and left cross).</li>\r\n<li></li>\r\n<li></li>\r\n<li></li>\r\n<li></li>\r\n<li></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Stance </strong></p>\r\n<p>Stance varies depending on the dominant hand of the boxer. If a boxer is right-handed, the left leg is usually in front while the left shoulder tits forward. However, if the boxer is left-handed (South paw) the right leg is in t and the right shoulder is in front n modem boxing there is no definite stance as smart and fast boxers are ways on their toes. This enables them to release jabs on their opponents without receiving any <strong>Foot work</strong> -This is a skillful movement of one&rsquo;s feet especially in dancing or playing a sport such as boxing, soccer, etc. A successful jab 3n an opponent is primarily brought about by a good footwork. It is also in attack and defense.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Punch</strong>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Boxing is all about punching and king points. There are four basic punches in boxing. They include the following:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Uppercut</li>\r\n<li></li>\r\n<li>Jab</li>\r\n<li>Hook</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Uppercut</strong></p>\r\n<p>This is vertical rising punch taken from below the with level of the opponent\'s chest the knees slightly bent. It is usually a devastation punch if executed.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<strong>Cross </strong></p>\r\n<p>This is a powerful, straight punch on the chin. There are two</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>types: The right cross and the left cross for the left-handed or south paw. The cross punch pierces any line of defence to its target-the chin.</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Jab</strong></p>\r\n<p>Jab is short quick, straight punch on its target. After making contact with the target, the lead hand is retracted (withdrawn) quicky to resume a guard in front of the face.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<strong>Hook</strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;The hook is a semicircular punch directed to the side of the opponent\'s head. Sometimes a hook may target the lower part of the body, this technique is sometimes called the &lsquo;rip&rsquo;. Mike Tyson used this technique often to demolish his opponents.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Attack </strong></p>\r\n<p>It is a forward movement into an opponent in order to score points using any of the punching techniques. In any successful attack an opponent is not given a chance to retaliate.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Dodging </strong></p>\r\n<p>Dodging simply means moving away from danger, so in bonding, it is moving away from the opponent&rsquo;s punches. This could take the form of bending low to avert a possible jab or hook from an opponent or stepping back with the head tilted backward, to avoid across or an uppercut.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<strong>Defence </strong></p>\r\n<p>This is an act of protecting someone from attack. This could take the form of stepping backwards or covering the vita! parts of the head-eye, ear, nose, etc. from being hit by the opponent.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h4>Unit 8</h4>\r\n<h4>Safety Rules in Boxing</h4>\r\n<p>Safety rules are very essential; sports in generally in order to avoid injry, be it minor, major, and Permanent injuries.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>These safety rules include: g.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Atypical boxing match is made up of nine (9) to twelve (12) rounds.</li>\r\n<li>Each round lasts three (3) minutes with one (1) minute break/rest at each boxer\'s corner.</li>\r\n<li>A fight is handled by a referee who moves to and from inside the ring to judge and control the conducts of the fighter</li>\r\n<li>There are usually three (3) judges the present at the ringside to assign to the boxers.</li>\r\n<li>At the end of the match/brut the holding the fighter who has the highest points punching is declared winner.</li>\r\n<li>A boxer is ruled &ldquo;Knocked out&rdquo; if he knocked down by an opponent with any part of the body other than before punching.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h4>Unit 9</h4>\r\n<h4>Officiating in boxing</h4>\r\n<p>Basically, there are four officials in boxing.

It means a group of people who&rsquo;s living together is made possible by birth or co-residence. They share their money, food, drinks sometimes expenses and thought. In most cases, a typical Nigerian family goes by a common surname. A family is also seen as the smallest of the society and the institution for socialization of children.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h5>Family Types</h5>\r\n<p>There are three (3) main types of family</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>The nuclear Family </strong>or immediate family. This is made up of father, mother and children and in the case of childlessness, husband and wife.</li>\r\n<li><strong>The extended family </strong>is made up of grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins, nephews, nieces and of course, the immediate parents.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Single Parent Family: </strong>This is made up of either a parent-father or parent-mother and children.</li>\r\n<li>However, there are other family variations.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Polygamous family: </strong>In this case the husband has two or more wives.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Step family:</strong> This is created as of death, divorce or separation.

She, with the help of the girls cook and serve the family food. There is a saying that the father is the head of family while the mother is in-charge of the home. She is in charge of all domestic chores. In any case roles are changing particularly in civilized families where working class&nbsp; mothers assist their husbands financially and husbands in tum help their wives in her domestic chores.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>The Daughter</strong></p>\r\n<p>Helps her mother in domestic work such as fetching water, going to the market to buy some food items, washing plates e.t.c</p>\r\n<p><strong>The son</strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;He performs the father&rsquo;s duties when the father is not around.

He helps the father in his fam work.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h4>Unit 3</h4>\r\n<h4>Puberty in Boys and Girls</h4>\r\n<h4>What is Puberty?</h4>\r\n<p>&nbsp;Puberty could be seen as the stage of physical development during which one can change from child to adult and is able to have children. It could also be seen as the period during which growing boys and girls undergo the process of maturation. This is evident in the development of some physical secondary sex characteristics such as pubic hairs, rapid growth, etc. The onset of puberty differs from one individual to the other. It differs from boys to girls. For example, the time Jane starts experiencing puberty may not be the time Mercy will experience hers yet they were born the same month. Again, puberty in girls occurs before that of the boys. Usually, Puberty in girls occurs between the ages 10 years to 14 years while that of the boys occurs between 12 years to 16 years. However, the above figures can no longer be relied on due to improvements on nutrition, environment, and genetic factors.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h5>Major Features of Puberty</h5>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Pubic hairs.</li>\r\n<li>Hairs in the armpit.</li>\r\n<li>Well-developed penis in boys.</li>\r\n<li>Temperamental i.e. easily upset or excited i.e. He or She can quarrel now and in the next hour he is friendly.</li>\r\n<li>Breast starts developing in girls.</li>\r\n<li>Enlarged vagina with noticeably</li>\r\n<li>rotund buttocks in girls.</li>\r\n<li>Strong emotional feelings.</li>\r\n<li>Smooth and fleshly tissue (body) in girls.</li>\r\n<li>Rapid growth with long legs and arms.</li>\r\n<li>Moustache, beard and chest hairs appear in boys; few girls develop these as well</li>\r\n<li>Male voice become sonorous while girls voice become shrill</li>\r\n<li>Some boys develop Adam\'s apple.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h4>Unit 4</h4>\r\n<h4>Assertiveness and Communication Skills</h4>\r\n<h4>Definition of Terms</h4>\r\n<p><strong>Assertive</strong> &mdash; This is saying or doing something with all amount of assurance before people. Assertiveness is not being aggressive rather, it is one is asking for his own while considering others people&rsquo;s rights, wants, and needs. In assertiveness, one considers the rights and privileges of the other person and by so doing, finds a balance. It is not always easy to identify assertive behavior. This is because there is a thin line between assertiveness and aggressiveness. Assertive people act to always achieve fair play and resist intimidation. When one treats others with fairness and respect, he or she gets that same treatment in return and people would want to work with him/her. It is unfortunate in our society today very few people are assertive.</p>\r\n<p>Assertiveness is important in our homes, society, the state, in the church for a better society. Some People are naturally more assertive towards being aggressive, it is important you work on the following</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Understand that your rights, thoughts, feelings, needs, and desires are just as important as everyone else\'s.</li>\r\n<li>Realize that they are not more important than anyone else&rsquo;s either.</li>\r\n<li>Recognize your right and go for it reasonably.</li>\r\n<li>Don&rsquo;t always put yourself in situation you apologize all the time.</li>\r\n<li>Allow yourself to be angry but be rights, wants, and needs. in respect</li>\r\n<li>Control yourself no matter the situation</li>\r\n<li>Learn to accept criticisms</li>\r\n<li>Know that you can&rsquo;t do everything or please everyone in everything for advice and direction.</li>\r\n<li>It has been observed that engaging in sports activities such as football, handball, volley ball, playing care watching T.V, video games dancing, writing listening to music or hanging out with friends help a lot to allay one&rsquo;s worries and anger.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h4>Unit 5 Communication Skill</h4>\r\n<p>Communication simply put, is the process by which people exchange information or express their thoughts, ideas and feelings. Communication is Vital in every aspect of life, be it in the home, church, organization, gymnasium classroom, etc.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;Any organization or system where communication skill lacking will always be in chaos. However, for communication to be effective, it is important to master the skills. It has been observed that most people particularly the young ones cannot communicate assertively without being aggressive. And as leaders of tomorrow it is pertinent that you learn to win the hearts of your listeners when addressing them. Assertive communication technique is essential. To convey basic assertions, it is good to use &ldquo;! want&rdquo;, &ldquo;I need&rdquo; or &ldquo;I feel&rsquo;. For example, Jane would rather suggest you keep this pregnancy to avoid exposing you to danger.</p>\r\n<p>If Jane insists, do not flay up rather change your verb. Jane, my daughter, have you forgotten that disobedience is not allowed in our family. Won\'t you listen to your father? at another aspect of assertive communication: Prepare ahead of time the message you want to convey. I cannot take on any more projects right now.</p>\r\n<p>During the conversation, keep restating your message using the same language over and over again. Don&rsquo;t relent. Eventually, the person is likely to realize that you mean what you are saying.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h4>Unit 6</h4>\r\n<h4>Teenage Pregnancy and Its consequences</h4>\r\n<p>The word teenage refers to those individuals from the age of thirteen (13) to nineteen (19) years old.

Whichever way teenage pregnancy is not the best because of the risks associated with it.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>The consequences of teenage Pregnancy are numerous</strong>. These include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The girl&rsquo;s education might be stalled if she is not from a rich home.</li>\r\n<li>It socially stigmatizes a girl leading to most of her friends abandoning her because she is now regarded as a mother who will take care of her baby while her peers are in school.</li>\r\n<li>There is also financial pressure on the family which may lead to poverty and malnutrition.</li>\r\n<li>Teenage may resort to drinking, drug abuse, and sometimes stealing.</li>\r\n<li>In most cultures and particularly in Africa, the child is branded a bastard and does not enjoy any family inheritance.</li>\r\n<li>Sometimes, mother and child are malnourished due to lack of good and balanced diet.</li>\r\n<li>A teenager may suffer an emotional crisis if she becomes pregnant and does not want the baby, this may lead to rash behaviour such as trying to abort the baby and suicide attempt.&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h4>Unit 7</h4>\r\n<h4>Career Guidance</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Career:</strong> The word career means a job or profession that you have been trained for and which you do for a long period of your life.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Guidance</strong>: This means help and advice that is given to someone about their work, education or personal life.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Career Guidance:</strong> Career Guidance consists of the services that help people successfully develop and manage their career development.

Ageing is not a one-day phenomenon. For instance, an old man complains of headache &lsquo;today, tomorrow it is backache, the following day it is his legs and muscles. That is why a writer defines ageing as a progressive functional decline or gradual deterioration of physiological function with age, including a decrease in fecundity (fertility).</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Ageing is characterized by changes which include:</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li></li>\r\n<li>Gradual reduction in height and weight due to loss of muscle and bone mass.</li>\r\n<li>Reduction in reaction time.</li>\r\n<li>Decline in sexual activities.</li>\r\n<li>Lower metabolic rate.</li>\r\n<li>Loss of interest in exercises.</li>\r\n<li>Decline in hearing and vision i.e. hearing and vision impaired.</li>\r\n<li>Deterioration in agility, flexibility, strength endurance, etc.</li>\r\n<li>Gradual breakdown or decay in memory (amnesia).</li>\r\n<li>Increase in inflammation levels resulting in arthritis.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h4>Unit 3</h4>\r\n<p>&nbsp;Life Enhancing Measures against Ageing</p>\r\n<p>Life enhancing measures are measures taken to reduce physical deterioration of the body and gracefully.

They are everywhere particularly dirty environment and dirty things for example faeces, refuse dumps, decayed materials. Because of the nature of its breeding place and its hairy nature it finds it easy to pick discharge from any disease carrier.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h5>Eggs.</h5>\r\n<p>&nbsp;As soon as the female housefly matures it starts to lay eggs, a common sight for this is the compost manure, faeces, etc. The eggs are usually laid in batches of 50, 100, 200 which take about twenty-four hours to hatch. This depends on the temperature of the environment.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h5>Larva Stage:</h5>\r\n<p>The larva or the maggot is the product of the hatched eggs. They are usually 1cm in length and Sluggish in movement. This makes them fall prey to reptile (lizard), fowls, birds, etc. As the larva continues to feed on the organic matters around it, it is transformed into another stage called pupa.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h5>Pupa Stage</h5>\r\n<p>At this stage the larva shortens and becomes brownish, hard and dormant.

At this stage the virus attacks the immune system of the body, and if not treated, may result in the destruction of the immune system. Note; immune system is the defence system of the body and if the body becomes defenceless, the body becomes open to disease invasion to all manner of diseases particularly tuberculosis.

(78, 1, 'Chapter 1', 'Living Things - Habitat</', '<h2>TOPIC 1: LIVING THINGS - HABITAT</h2>\r\n<h3>Ecology</h3>\r\n<p>The term ecology can be defined as the scientific study of organisms in relation to their environment. Ecology is usually studied in biology. It is in fact a practical science. Ecology involves:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Finding out how living organisms depend on one another and their non-living environment for survival.</li>\r\n<li>Studying the distribution of living organisms in the environment</li>\r\n<li>Measuring factors which affect the environment.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The environment of an organism is made up of all factors found in its surroundings which affect the organism. They consist of biotic and abiotic factors.</p>\r\n<h4>Biotic Factors</h4>\r\n<p>Biotic consists of the living part or component of environment. Examples are:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>Food producers (Autotrophs):</strong> These are organisms which can use simple inorganic materials like carbon (IV) oxide and water to make their own food (i.e. starch) e.g. green plants, protophyta and chemosynthetic bacteria.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Food Consumers (Heterotrophs):</strong> These are animals, protozoa and some bacteria which cannot manufacture their own food. They feed on plants and other animal products, e.g. man, birds, goats, sheep, dog, toads, fishes, and so on.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Decomposers (Saprophytes):</strong> Decomposers or saprophytes are organisms which break down plant and animal products by feeding on them e.g. fungi and some bacteria. The observable breakdown of tissues of plants and animals products they feed on is referred to as decay.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h4>Abiotic Factors</h4>\r\n<p>These consist of the non-living components of an environment which an organism needs in order to stay alive or survive e.g. soil, wood, rocks and so on.</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>Climatic Factor:</strong> Temperature, sunlight, rainfall, humidity, wind pressure, turbidity and so on.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Edaphic Factors (soil):</strong> Soil profile, soil texture, soil water content, soil pH, humus content of the soil, inorganic nutrients like carbon (IV) oxide, nitrogen, phosphorous and so on.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Topographic Factors:</strong> Shape of the land, altitude, drainage and so on.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Chemical Factors:</strong> Carbon (IV) oxide, nitrogen oxygen and mineral salts.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h4>Habitat</h4>\r\n<p>Habitat may be defined as the place where an organism lives. It is a place that is suitable to its way of life. For example a habitat may be small such as the elementary canal of a mammalian host where roundworms live or it may be large such as a river or ocean where fishes live. Another example of a large habitat is the savanna where the zebra could be found. The caterpillar lives on the leaves and zebra could be found in the savanna.</p>\r\n<h5>Examples of Habitats</h5>\r\n<p>There are three types of habitats, namely: Aquatic (water) habitat, Terrestrial (land) habitat and arboreal (aerial) habitat</p>\r\n<h6>Aquatic Habitat</h6>\r\n<p>This is a water habitat which may be subdivided into fresh water and salt water (marine) habitats.</p>\r\n<p>Fresh water habitat has no noticeable amount of salt in it. Some examples are rivers, ponds, streams, springs and lakes. The following plants may be found in fresh water habitats which include: Chlamydomonas, blue green algae, diatoms, euglena, spirogyra, water ferns, water hyacinth, duckweed, water lettuce, water lilies and liver-wort. The animals found in fresh water habitats include larvae and pupae of mosquitoes, amoeba, paramecium, flatworms, water snails, tadpoles, dragonfly larvae, leeches, water scorpions, hydra, frogs, toads, fishes, monitor lizards, tortoises, water snakes and so on.</p>\r\n<p>Salt water habitat has a high content of salt in it. Examples are oceans and seas. Plants found in salt water habitats include sponges, seaweeds, etc. while the animals found in this habitat include crabs, lobsters, crayfish, stingray fish, crocodiles, periwinkles, sea urchins, sea cucumbers, etc.</p>\r\n<h6>Terrestrial Habitat</h6>\r\n<p>This is a dry land habitat. In Nigeria, three local terrestrial habitats can be identified namely: Mangrove swamp, Tropical rainforest, Savanna</p>\r\n<p>These are called biomes. Biomes are large natural terrestrial units of the environment. Each biome is identified by its dominant vegetation (plants) it has. For example, a forest biome has densely packed tall trees, while grasses and a few scattered shrubs are found in a savanna biome. The type of vegetation in a biome is largely determined by climatic factors especially rainfall and temperature. There is also the semi-desert and desert biomes with little or no rainfall throughout the year and scanty (few) vegetation.</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>Mangrove Swamp:</strong> These are found in the tropics along coastal regions and river moths. In Nigeria, mangrove swamps are found in the delta region of Lagos, Edo, Delta, Rivers and Cross River states. Much silt I s deposited near the river banks. This becomes muddy and water-logged when the river overflows its bank to form swamps. Plants like red and white mangrove trees and evergreen trees survive in swamps because they have prop roots and breathing roots. These features enable them to grow in the soft swampy areas. Animals found here may include slugs, crabs, snails, shrimps and prawns.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Tropical Rain Forests:</strong> The climate in tropical rain forest id hot and wet throughout the year. The tropical rainforest is dense and made up of many types of broad-leaved trees that are mostly evergreen, i.e. The trees drop their leaves gradually throughout the year, and new leaves grow continuously to replace them. The trees form three layers. The small trees form the bottom canopy, the tall trees form the middle canopy while the very tall trees like mahogany, iroko, obeche and walnut form the thick top canopy that prevents sunlight from reaching the forest floor. As a result, the vegetation on the forest floor is sparse. Epiphytic plants like ferns, orchids and woody climbers grow on tall trees to receive sunlight. In Nigeria, tropical rain forests cover parts of Oyo, Delta, Edo, Imo, Cross River, Ogun, Ondo, Anambra, Enugu and Rivers States. It is usually hot and wet with temperatures of about 27â° Some of the animals found in rainforests live on trees (arboreal) e.g. tree frogs, tree snakes, geckos, chameleons, bats, flying squirrels and monkeys. There may be other animals like rats, lizards, land snakes, leopards, weaver birds, hornbills, parrots and owls.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Savanna or Tropical Grassland Biome:</strong> The savanna is usually flat for miles at a stretch. The rainfall of the savanna is insufficient to support a rich growth of trees and therefore the vegetation is mainly grasses with a few scattered shrubs in sparse population. This can prevent desert encroachment from forming. The savanna regions have a hot, wet, season which alternates with a cool dry season. In Nigeria, savanna biome is found in parts of the north such as Kaduna, Kwara, Benue, Kano, Sokoto, Bauchi, Niger and Borno States. The plants found here are mainly perennial grasses with clusters of trees. Animals found include mice, rats, snakes, squirrels, antelopes, giraffes, leopards, lions, zebra, jackals, hyenas and elephants. The common insects found here include grasshoppers, termites, locust, ants and so on. You can also see such birds as vultures, ostriches and so on.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h5>Adaptations of Living Things to their Habitats</h5>\r\n<p>Living organisms found in different types of habitats develop special features that enable them to live successfully and reproduce in a particular environment. These features may be structural, functional or behavioral. Such features are known as adaptations. Adaptation may be defined as changes in structure, function and behavior in living organisms which enable them to adjust and survive in their environments.</p>\r\n<h5>Relationships between Organisms in the same Habitat and what they have in common</h5>\r\n<h6>Aquatic Organisms</h6>\r\n<p>Aquatic organisms that move actively use appendages like fins which are modified for swimming. Aquatic organisms have no need to conserve water; hence, gaseous exchange occurs throughout the whole body surface or through special structures called gills. The adaptations are mainly functional.</p>\r\n<h6>&nbsp;</h6>\r\n<h6>Terrestrial Organisms</h6>\r\n<p>These are faced with a great problem of water loss from their bodies. Plants overcome this problem by having water proof cuticles covering their external surfaces. They also have well developed roots for the continual absorption of water from the soil. Terrestrial animals have developed exoskeletons for invertebrates which cover the entire body and with such features as scales, feathers and hair for vertebrates which reduce water loss. Vertebrates use organs such as lungs which are enclosed within the body for gaseous exchange. These animals also have excretory structures such as Malpighian tubules and kidneys which are efficient at reabsorbing water and salts. Thus in order to conserve water, terrestrial organisms adapts both functionally and structurally.</p>\r\n<h5>Uniqueness of Human Beings</h5>\r\n<p>Man belongs to a group of vertebrates called mammals. Mammals are warm-blooded animals that have bodies covered with hair or fur. They also give birth to their young ones alive and feed them milk from their mammary glands. They have well developed brains and respire through their lungs. Other examples of mammals include, cow, goat, sheep, dog, monkey, lion, zebra, elephants and so on. Some mammals that are not well developed like the kangaroos give birth to their young ones and carry them in a pouch inside their mother&rsquo;s skin. They are fed with milk till they become very strong.</p>\r\n<h5>Characteristics of Primates</h5>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Their hands are for holding things firmly</li>\r\n<li>Their hands and feet have five digits</li>\r\n<li>The position of their eyes is in front of their heads and not at the sides.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Other primate animals include gorilla, chimpanzee, baboon and lemurs. Some of the primates have tails like monkeys and baboons while others do not have visible tails like man gorilla and chimpanzee.</p>\r\n<p>Man is unique and distinguishes himself from the rest of the primates in the following ways:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The human brain is complex and highly developed. This helps man to coordinate and make effective use of various parts of his body especially the hands which enable man to handle and manipulate instruments and acquire new skills that help him to control and adapt to new changes in his environment and live a better life.</li>\r\n<li>The complexity and development of man&rsquo;s brain help to coordinate thinking and speech excellently well making him the most intelligent animal. Intelligence refers to the ability to learn, understand, and think in logical ways as well as recall or remember what has been learnt. Therefore, man is able to learn new things, get a=understanding of concepts and reasons in ways that enable him to solve all sorts of human and environmental problems.</li>\r\n<li>The brain enables man to develop speech as an effective means of communication using sounds and words which are understood by the people engaged in communication. By this means, man is able to learn new skills and transfer it to others. Man can communicate via different means using print, electronic media, etc. in addition to oral communication.</li>\r\n<li>Man has an S-shaped curve of his backbone which enables him to stand in an upright position and therefore maintain a good balance. Other primates find it difficult to stand upright.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h5>Measurement of Growth in Living Things</h5>\r\n<p>The growth of an organism can be measured in terms of its:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Weight</li>\r\n<li>Length, height or width and</li>\r\n<li>Area or volume (size) over a period of time.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>In seedlings for instance, the number of leaves may be used as a growth indicator or index. Each of these growth indicators is known as a parameter of growth. The use of growth parameters or indices depends on the type of organism and its growth pattern. For instance it is possible to measure the height of a maize plant to estimate the growth but we cannot use the same parameter to assess the growth of a mouse. In such a situation, area and volume (size) measurements become very apt and can give an accurate picture of growth. However, these parameters are difficult to measure and are not so commonly used.</p>\r\n<p>Mass and length (height or width) are the most commonly used growth parameters since they are easy to measure. In most growth studies, mass may be measured as wet mass or dry mass. Wet mass is the mass of the organism under normal conditions. It is not a reliable growth indicator. Dry mass is the mass of an organism after all the water in it has been removed. Measuring growth in terms of dry mass is an accurate and reliable method of estimating an organism&rsquo;s growth. The problem with using dry mass is that the organism gets killed in the process.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Growth</strong> can be defined as a permanent increase in size and weight of an organism due to food intake and formation of new cell materials. It is one of the basic characteristics of living things and it is an irreversible permanent increase in physical size needed during development by all organisms. One of the unique features of biological growth is that the organism feeds and makes use of its food to build up its own type of cell materials. This results in changes in size and weight and to some extent in chemical composition, although it still retains its integrity and individuality. This is true because growth fundamentally involves synthesis by the organism of more materials like itself. Growth involves the following processes:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Increase in the number of cells (cell division)</li>\r\n<li>Increase in the size of cells (cell enlargement)</li>\r\n<li>Cell differentiation, in which case some newly produced cells can diversify in structure and function and thereby becoming different from other cells</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Living cells grow by synthesizing new protoplasm. Protoplasm is a jelly-like colloidal substance conceived of as constituting the living matter of plant and animal cells and performing the basic life functions. The newly manufactured protoplasm divides into smaller cells and then repeating the process over and over as long as essential nutrients are supplied and accumulation of harmful wastes is prevented. Growth in animals is known as intercalary. This means that cell division and enlargement takes place all over the whole parts of the organism and there are increases in size and weight as a result. However, in plants, growth is described as apical This means that cell division and enlargement takes place at the root and shoot tips or apices. Plants have unlimited growth patterns. That is they grow throughout their life time. But animals on the other hand have limited growth patterns. Animals attain maturity in growth after which growth stops. The chemical requirements for growth in animals include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Water</li>\r\n<li>Inorganic substance like calcium, magnesium, silicon, phosphorus and carbon which are needed in large quantities for the formation of skeletal and other supporting structures</li>\r\n<li>Organic substances especially certain amino acids and fatty acids</li>\r\n<li>Accessory factors or vitamins.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h5>Growth Changes in Living Things</h5>\r\n<p>Growth is a common characteristic of living things. It occurs due to the process of cell division. Increase in height and weight of an organism are indicators that growth is taking place. Therefore measurement of changes in height and weight could be used as indices for growth. Less developed animals like the paramecium and some vertebrate animals like fishes and lizards show a pattern of unlimited growth. Their growth tends to be continuous but the growth rate reduces as they get older. In the case of some invertebrate animals like insects, these have exoskeletons that do not allow continuous growth. However, there is always rapid growth at the time when the exoskeleton is removed before the new one hardens.</p>\r\n<p>In multicellular animals like birds and mammals, these show a pattern of limited growth. An example is man which grows to the stage of sexual maturity after which there is little or no further growth taking place. Five stages in the growth pattern of a man can be identified.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Infancy (0-2 years)</li>\r\n<li>Juvenile (Childhood, 2-12 years)</li>\r\n<li>Adolescence (12-17 years)</li>\r\n<li>Adulthood (20 years and above)</li>\r\n<li>Old age (65 years and above)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>In man, there are two periods of great rapid growth namely infancy and adolescence. Within these periods, there is fast increase in size, height and weight.</p>\r\n<p>The infancy period stretches from birth to about two years of age. At this stage, the child derives a lot of pleasure in eating and increases in size and weight. The adolescence period is between 12-17 years of age. At this stage, the child grows into puberty during which a child&rsquo;s sexual organs begin to mature in both males and females. A lot of internal and external changes go on in their bodies and these are called puberty changes. Apart from these two periods of rapid growth, growth rate slows down until he/she attains sexual maturity. Further growth in height stops. However, at old age, there is negative growth because at this stage, man begins to reduce in size and weight. For many animals including man, their growth curve is S-shaped.</p>\r\n<h5>Characteristics of Growth in Living Organisms</h5>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>It results in physically observable increase in size, height and weight.</li>\r\n<li>The increase is brought about by assimilation of food by the cell leading to formation of new cell materials.</li>\r\n<li>The increase is an irreversible change and therefore is permanent.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h5>Development in living Things</h5>\r\n<p>In living things especially man, development can be seen as a series of gradual changes in the organism that result in the maturation of tissues, organs and systems of the body to effectively carry out their biological functions. It involves all the processes that lead eventually to the formation of a new animal starting from the cells derived from one or more parent individuals. While growth indicates a change in a particular stage in an organism, development involves physical, social, intellectual or mental changes in an individual. It should be noted that growth and development processes go on together at the same time.</p>\r\n<h5>Development Changes in Living Things</h5>\r\n<p>For man, the following stages are identifiable:</p>\r\n<h6>Infancy (0-2 years)</h6>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The newborn child looks very tender, fragile and has little or no motor control. The neck hardly carries the head but about 3-4 months, a child can hold it upright.</li>\r\n<li>The skeletons are very soft and are composed of cartilages which are fragile.</li>\r\n<li>Major milestones include rapid increase in body weight as the child feeds exclusively on breast milk for the first six months after birth. The mother&rsquo;s breast milk contains many nutrients including antibodies which give the baby immunity against infectious diseases. The first breast milk of the mother is called colostrum and is usually yellowish in color.</li>\r\n<li>The baby begins to react to certain stimuli like hunger, pain, wet nappies and other discomforts by crying.</li>\r\n<li>The newborn child begins to recognize faces and see objects. This shows brain development.</li>\r\n<li>About 4-5 months, the baby&rsquo;s neck bones are strong and can carry the head upright. Also the milk teeth begin to develop.</li>\r\n<li>About 6 months old, the baby starts rolling over and sitting up unassisted and without any support as the skeletons and muscles are becoming stronger to carry the body weight.</li>\r\n<li>About 7-8 months, the baby gradually begins to crawl and creep towards objects especially colorful ones.</li>\r\n<li>The baby makes effort to reach objects that are far from his creeping position and makes several attempts to stand up and lift his leg to walk though he falls and stands up again and again.</li>\r\n<li>9 months &ndash; 1 year, the baby purposefully begins to babble and laugh or squeal with emotions. He may have the ability to say simple words such as mama.</li>\r\n<li>The baby grows more teeth.</li>\r\n<li>Between 1-2 years, the baby is making major strides towards independence. During this toddler stage, the baby is up on his feet walking and running. He can kick a ball, walk up and down stairs with help and carries objects while moving. The baby can scribble making marks that he sees as real objects, build block towers and starts to feed by himself. Language and communication skills sharply increase as he speaks audibly well. Socially and emotionally, the baby is immature having little self-control and an unsophisticated style when playing with peers.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h6>Early Childhood (3-5 years)</h6>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The baby can move well, kicking a ball with ease and even throwing a ball overhead. The child can climb on play equipment, somersault and skip. This is because the child&rsquo;s fine motor skills are rapidly developing.</li>\r\n<li>There is an increase in height which may be as a result of rapid growth and development of bones and strengthening of the muscles.</li>\r\n<li>The child can talk very well, eat on his own and help in domestic chores</li>\r\n<li>The child&rsquo;s motor and cognitive skills are rapidly developing and he can now draw geometric shapes, patterns and human figures and writes some letters of the alphabet.</li>\r\n<li>Emotionally, the child begins to build greater self-regulatory abilities and can now verbally express his feelings instead of using gestures or physical aggression.</li>\r\n<li>Socially, the child is now entering a new world where he is making his first true friends based on similar interests. The child has acquired the skills to share and take turns and can show empathy towards others. This is referred to as pre-school age.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h6>Childhood (6-11 years)</h6>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>At this stage, the child may rely on parents for his emotional and social needs. He begins schooling and can participate in class work.</li>\r\n<li>Girls grow taller and bigger than boys of the same age.</li>\r\n<li>Much skeletal development as the bones harden</li>\r\n<li>The child starts to lose temporary (milk) teeth which are replaced by permanent teeth.</li>\r\n<li>Physically, the child has the gross motor abilities to tackle new forms of movement in sports and dance lessons.</li>\r\n<li>Academically, the child can write the alphabets very well and can draw geometric shapes.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<h6>Puberty (12-17 years)</h6>\r\n<p>At this stage, children go through a set of physical changes known as puberty.

(79, 2, 'Chapter 2', 'Chemicals', '<h2>TOPIC 2: CHEMICALS</h2>\r\n<p>A chemical can be defined as a substance having a specific molecular composition which is produced by or used in a chemical process. Alternatively, it can also be defined as any substance used in or resulting from a reaction involving changes in atoms or molecules especially one derived artificially for practical use. An example is sodium chloride (common salt) NaCl. Chemicals can be classified based on the use of the chemical and the hazardous nature of the chemical.</p>\r\n<h3>Classification of Chemicals Based on the Use of the Chemical</h3>\r\n<p>The various areas of use of chemicals are Pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, nuclear, agrochemical, industrial and laboratory chemicals.</p>\r\n<h4>Pharmaceutical</h4>\r\n<p>A pharmaceutical chemical is a substance used in preparing and dispensing drugs. In this industry, the purity of the chemical (drug) is of high importance and strict regulations are applied to control the manufacture and sale of the drug. Some pharmaceutical chemicals are inorganic compounds. Examples include potassium bromide used as a sedative, bismuthtrioxocarbonate (IV) used to cure stomach disorders, mercury (II) trioxonitrate (V) used as an antiseptic for skin diseases. The organic compounds may be specific drugs for certain diseases such as paludrine and plasmoquin which are anti-malarial drugs or analgesics (pain relievers) such as paracetamol and panadol or anesthetics such as chloroform and novacaine or antibiotics such as penicillin.</p>\r\n<h4>Cosmetics</h4>\r\n<p>The cosmetic industry uses thousands of synthetic chemicals in its products designed to beautify the body by direct application. Some of these cosmetics include shampoos, lipsticks, creams, lotions and perfumes. Some of the chemicals commonly found in cosmetics are phthalates, triclosan, 1,4-dioxane, parabens, ethylene oxide, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, placental extract, lead, aluminum and so on.</p>\r\n<h4>Agrochemical</h4>\r\n<p>This is a term used to refer to various chemical products used in agriculture such as fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides, fungicides and soil conditioners. They are applied to plants. Examples of fertilizers include aluminiumtrioxonitrate (V), ammoniumtetraoxosulphate (VI), urea and so on.</p>\r\n<h4>Industrial Chemicals</h4>\r\n<p>These chemicals can be used for different purposes in different industries and fields such as petrochemicals, construction, sewage treatment, desalination plants, oil and gas fields. Some examples of industrial chemicals are alcohols, acids, activated alumina, chlorides, carbonates, ethanol amines, oxides, sulphates, hydrocarbons and so on.</p>\r\n<h4>Laboratory Chemicals</h4>\r\n<p>A laboratory can be defined as a room or building equipped for scientific research, experimentation, teaching or for the manufacture of drugs and chemicals. Some common laboratory chemicals are mineral acids, bases, common organic acids, common acid-base indicators, flammable liquid and so on.</p>\r\n<h3>Classification of Chemicals Based on Hazardous Nature</h3>\r\n<p>Some chemicals are very dangerous when they make contact with the skin or poisonous when they get into the body. Therefore such chemicals must be handled carefully so that they do not harm us. Some are in aqueous solutions (liquids) while some are solids and yet others in gaseous (or vapor) form. Hazardous and toxic substances are defined as those chemicals present in the workplace which are capable of causing harm to people. These chemical substances could be classified in the following ways:</p>\r\n<h4>Highly Hazardous and Toxic (Poisonous) Chemicals</h4>\r\n<p>These include acids, alkalis, water reactive alkali metals, sulphides, metal salts, cyanides, organic substances, radioactive substances and so on.</p>\r\n<h4>Moderately Hazardous and Toxic Chemicals</h4>\r\n<p>Examples include hydrogen peroxide, propanone, trioxocarbonate (IV) acid, sodium trioxocarbonate (IV), and ammonia solution.</p>\r\n<h4>Non-hazardous Chemicals</h4>\r\n<p>Examples include water, buffer, ion resins, alumina, silica, sodium chloride, magnesiumtetraoxosulphate (VI) and calcium acetate.</p>\r\n<h3>Further Classification of Chemicals</h3>\r\n<p>Chemicals could also be further classified as fine chemicals and heavy chemicals.</p>\r\n<h4>Fine Chemicals</h4>\r\n<p>These are chemicals manufactured in relatively small quantities for specific use. They have high degree of purity and are expensive. Examples are dyes, perfumes, drugs, photographic materials, analytical chemicals and additives for paints and fuels.</p>\r\n<h4>Heavy Chemicals</h4>\r\n<p>These are essential chemicals for all branches of industry such as glass, textile, soap, metals and paints. They are manufactured in great quantity with a relatively lower degree of purity than fine chemicals. Examples include tetraoxosulphate (VI) acid, lime, trioxonitrate (V) acid, bleaching powder, caustic potash, caustic soda and sodium trioxocarbonate (IV).</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>Safety Measures When Using Chemicals</h3>\r\n<p>Planning, handling and maintenance of storage areas are necessary to avoid material losses, accidents and disasters. Good housekeeping and other safety measures are essential and special attention should be paid to incompatible substances, suitable location of products and climatic conditions. The following safety measures should be taken when using chemicals:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Adhere to the manufacturer&rsquo;s safety instruction</li>\r\n<li>Follow safety guidelines for chemical storage and handling</li>\r\n<li>Observe and adhere to safety signs and instructions on chemical packages</li>\r\n<li>Ensure proper labeling and storage of chemical</li>\r\n<li>No container of chemicals should be handled without labels containing identification of content and other relevant information regarding handling and safety</li>\r\n<li>Do not touch, taste, inhale, or allow them to spill on you</li>\r\n<li>Always wear safety materials such as a nose mask, goggle, gloves, boots, laboratory aprons/coats, etc. when visiting the laboratory or handling chemicals.</li>\r\n</ul>', 'JSS 2', 'Basic Science', '2021-10-13 13:05:42', '2021-10-13 13:05:42'),

Work is associated with motion (movement). If any force remains in a point even for a period of time, work is not done. Work is said to be done if the force moves and causes displacement in the direction of the force. For example, work is done when a lump of stone is moves over a certain distance or when a vehicle moves a certain distance with bags of rice packed in it. In these examples, the amount of work done is the product of the force used and the distance covered in the direction of the force.</p>\r\n<p>Mathematically, Work (W) = Force (F) x Distance (S) in the direction of the force.</p>\r\n<p>The S.I. unit of work is the Joule (J).

The above law remains true except in atomic and nuclear reactions. In order to measure the quantity of energy used up in the process of doing work, only potential and kinetic energy will be discussed.</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<h5>Potential Energy</h5>\r\n<p>This is the energy a body possesses because of its position. This is the energy stored up in a body at rest. A body that is in position from which it can do or perform work is said to have potential energy. Examples are a stretched catapult, a compressed spring and an orange fruit hanging on a tree. These all have potentials to do work.

Matter exists in three different states &ndash; solid, liquid and gas. The idea of kinetic theory is that matter is made up of tiny particles which are in motion. These particles possess kinetic energy. As the particles continue to bombard the surfaces, they exert pressure on them. The kinetic theory is derived from particulate theory of matter which states:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>All matter is made up of atoms and molecules</li>\r\n<li>These particles called molecules are in a constant state of motion</li>\r\n<li>Because they are in motion, they possess kinetic energy</li>\r\n<li>The particles exert attractive forces on one another</li>\r\n<li>The nearer the particles are to each other, the greater the attractive force.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Molecular Structure of Matter</h3>\r\n<p>Matter exists in three states (forms) namely: solid, liquid and gas. It is made up of atoms and molecules. These molecules of matter are always in motion. The arrangement of these particles depends on the force of attraction existing between them. This makes them to exist in three states &ndash; solid, liquid and gas.</p>\r\n<h4>Properties of Solids</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Solid particles are arranged in regular patterns with strong intermolecular bonds</li>\r\n<li>They are normally hard and rigid</li>\r\n<li>They have fixed shapes and volumes</li>\r\n<li>They are not easily squeezed into smaller sizes</li>\r\n<li>Particles of solids shake when heat is supplied and intermolecular spaces are created. As more heat is supplied, the solid structure breaks down, expands and melts. During the process of cooling they revert to solid state. This is also known as freezing. The temperature at which solid changes into liquid form or melts is known as melting point. A solid can change directly into gaseous state without first changing into liquid form. This phenomenon is called sublimation.</li>\r\n<li>Solids have high density compared to that of liquid.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>Properties of Liquids</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Liquid particles are loosely arranged with small intermolecular spaces</li>\r\n<li>They are held by weak intermolecular bonds which bind they together in clusters</li>\r\n<li>They have no fixed shape but take the shape of their container</li>\r\n<li>Liquids have fixed volume and is incompressible</li>\r\n<li>When heat is supplied to a liquid, it expands by boiling when it reaches a temperature known as boiling point</li>\r\n<li>Liquids have high density compared to that of gas.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>Properties of Gas</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Gas particles are very loosely arranged with much intermolecular space</li>\r\n<li>The intermolecular bond between gas molecules is very weak (almost negligible)</li>\r\n<li>Particles of Gases move more randomly colliding with one another and the walls of their container causing pressure</li>\r\n<li>They have no fixed shapes or volumes</li>\r\n<li>They can be compressed</li>\r\n<li>When heat is supplied to gas molecules it expands by travelling further

gas are very small</li>\r\n<li>The temperature of the gas increases as the average kinetic energy of the gas molecules increases.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Also note the following.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Boiling is the changing of any liquid into gaseous form by heating it to a specific temperature.</li>\r\n<li>Evaporation is the changing of liquid into vapor or gaseous form without direct heating</li>\r\n<li>Freezing is the change of a liquid into a solid form as a result of extreme cooling</li>\r\n<li>Condensation is the process by which a gas changes into a liquid

Heat transfer by conduction requires a solid material medium. Heat transfer by conduction can also take place in liquids and gases but they are very poor conductors.</p>\r\n<h6>Good and Bad conductors of Heat Energy</h6>\r\n<p>Conductors allow heat energy to pass through them. Generally, metals are good conductors of heat. Non-metals such as wood, cotton, plastic, rubber, etc. do not allow heat to pass through them and are said to be poor conductors or insulators.</p>\r\n<p>Convection: This is the method of heat transfer in which liquid molecules acquire heat energy and get energized to move in order to transfer heat to the colder molecules. Heat transfer by convection occurs in liquids and gases. The applications of convection current are in the ventilation of a room and in land and sea breezes near the riverine areas.</p>\r\n<p>Radiation: Heat energy is transferred from place to place through empty space in the form of waves. Radiation does not require any material medium for heat transfer. An example of heat transfer by radiation is the heat from the sun that reaches the earth by radiation.</p>\r\n<h4>Absorption of Heat Energy</h4>\r\n<p>When heat Energy falls on any object, it may be reflected, absorbed or allowed to pass through it.

(83, 6, 'Chapter 6', 'Crude Oil and Petro-Chemicals', '<h2>TOPIC 6: CRUDE OIL AND PETRO-CHEMICALS</h2>\r\n<h3>Meaning of Crude Oil</h3>\r\n<p>Crude Oil can also be called petroleum. It is a dark sticky viscous liquid which is found in underground deposits in some parts of the world. Crude oil is a complex mixture of hydrocarbons. A hydrocarbon is a compound containing carbon and hydrogen only. Natural gas which is equally a mixture of hydrocarbons is usually found together with crude oil. Petroleum is composed of gaseous, liquid and solid hydrocarbons (alkanes, alkenes, cycloalkanes, aromatic hydrocarbons) and other compounds. These are also called petrochemicals because they are products obtained from petroleum.</p>\r\n<h3>Origin of Crude Oil and Natural Gas</h3>\r\n<p>Crude oil and natural gas are formed from the remains of dead marine algae (plants) and animals once living in the sea. They are known as fossil fuels. These plants and animals were buried under the sea bed millions of years ago. Through the activity of bacteria, heat and pressure, these plant and animal remains changed gradually into crude oil and natural gas. The oil and gas formed slowly moved to other areas through tiny holes or pores in the porous rocks and around them. Since oil and gas are not dense, they tend to seep upwards until they meet a non-porous layer of rocks which trap them underneath to form an oil trap.</p>\r\n<h3>Oil Exploration and Drilling</h3>\r\n<p>The search for crude oil is known as exploration. This can be done through aerial photography, examining the surface rocks, mapping the earth&rsquo;s layers and drilling. This begins with geologists. When they identify the types of rock found near oil-bearing areas through mapping, they now work as a team involving other scientists and engineers and drilling begins. Drilling is the process of extracting crude oil from oil traps with pipes. Some of the area of oil location could be on land but many are found deep inside the sea.</p>\r\n<p>Crude oil is extracted by drilling deep holes or wells into the ground using rotary rig which drives down strong pipes to reach the oil trap. &nbsp;Natural gas comes out first under pressure. It is similar to how water is pumped out of borehole but more complicated. Later, the oil comes up as it is being pumped out. The oil is then stored in large steel tanks in oil fields until it is sent to oil refineries for purification through pipelines or tankers. The color of the oil varies from amber to greenish brown and to black. The color depends on the area of the location.</p>\r\n<h3>Nigeria&rsquo;s Crude Oil Reserves</h3>\r\n<p>This was first discovered at Olobini in 1956 in the Niger Delta Region. On land, there are large oil fields in Niger Delta, Afam, Abata, Bonny, Owaza, Egbema, Ugheli, Kokori, Oleh and Bomu. Oil also occurs offshore at Calabar and in the Burutu zone of Delta State. Today, crude oil deposits have been found in coastal areas of Rivers, Akwa-Ibom, Imo and Abia States. Nigeria is one of the leading oil producing countries in the world and an important member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). Oil refineries in Nigeria are located in Port Harcourt, Emene, Warri and Kaduna.</p>\r\n<h3>Refining of Crude Oil &ndash; Fractional Distillation</h3>\r\n<p>Crude oil is a mixture of several hydrocarbons. Refining means the preparation of useful products from crude oil. The process of refining is to separate the oil mixture into different components called fractions. Crude oil is also referred to as black gold because of its high value when it is refined. The oil is first of all cleaned up in the field after drilling to remove certain impurities like water, gas, sulphur and nitrogen-containing substances before sending it to the refineries through a network of pipelines.</p>\r\n<h3>Products of Refined Oil and Their Uses</h3>\r\n<h4>Natural Gas</h4>\r\n<p>Natural gas is usually found together with crude oil. It consists of gaseous hydrocarbons, mainly methane although having other components like propane and butane which can be readily liquefied under pressure and stored as Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG). This is stored in steel cylinders and used as domestic and industrial cooking gas. Natural gas is colorless, odorless and tasteless and as a result hydrogen sulphide is added to it to enable its users smell it whenever there is a leakage and at the same time serve as a safety measure to avoid fire accident.</p>\r\n<h5>Uses of Natural Gas</h5>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>LNG is used for domestic and industrial cooking and heating purposes</li>\r\n<li>It is used as a raw material for paints, plastics, fertilizers, photographic films and explosives</li>\r\n<li>It is used as fuel for heavy-duty vehicles and engines</li>\r\n<li>It is used to power stations for electricity generation</li>\r\n<li>Some industries use it to produce steel, gas, paper clothing and so on.</li>\r\n<li>It could also be used to operate furnaces, water heaters, cloth driers and other household appliances</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>Petrochemicals</h4>\r\n<p>Petrochemicals are chemical products derived from petroleum and natural gas. They can be obtained in two ways. In the first instance, they may be present in raw crude oil and then extracted during the process of fractional distillation of crude oil. They are then treated to produce organic chemicals that could be used as raw materials for other products. Examples include methane, ethane and propene as gaseous hydrocarbons. However, they may be synthesized during crude oil refining process.</p>\r\n<h5>Uses of Petrochemicals</h5>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>They are used in making synthetic rubbers for tyres, footwear and plastics</li>\r\n<li>They are used for making synthetic fibres like nylon ropes, threads and clothes</li>\r\n<li>They are used as raw materials for making drugs and cosmetics and so on</li>\r\n<li>They are also useful in making agro-chemicals such as fertilizers, pesticides, insecticides, herbicides, fungicides and so on</li>\r\n<li>An important petrochemical use is in the manufacture of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) polyethene bags as well as irrigation pipes</li>\r\n<li>Other petrochemicals are also used in the manufacture of paints, dyes, detergents, solvents and so on</li>\r\n<li>Some of the petrochemicals are used in the school laboratory for science practical. Examples include ethanol propanone, benzene, phenol, and toluene.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Importance of Crude Oil to Nigeria</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Crude Oil is a great foreign exchange earner. The economy of Nigeria is almost totally dependent on crude oil. Oil is responsible for more than 95% of the country&rsquo;s foreign exchange earnings. The money earned from oil is used to finance other developmental projects in the country</li>\r\n<li>Crude oil exploration and refining provides employment opportunities to many skilled and unskilled Nigerians</li>\r\n<li>Petroleum and natural gas are used for generating electricity which is widely used in homes, offices and industries</li>\r\n<li>Petroleum products are used extensively as the greatest sources of chemical energy in homes, offices and industries</li>\r\n<li>Petroleum products and natural gas serve as raw materials for various petrochemical industries.</li>\r\n</ul>', 'JSS 2', 'Basic Science', '2021-10-13 13:05:43', '2021-10-13 13:05:43'),
(84, 7, 'Chapter 7', 'First Aid', '<h2>TOPIC 7: FIRST AID</h2>\r\n<p>First aid is a treatment given to a casualty to sustain life, to prevent his condition from becoming worse and to promote his recovery by an expert or medical personnel. It is also the application of accepted principles of treatment on the occurrence of an accident or in the case of sudden illness using facilities or materials available at the time. Due to the increasing number and serious nature of accidents of all kinds, the responsibility of the first aider has become greater.</p>\r\n<h3>The Primary Objective of First Aid</h3>\r\n<p>First aid treatment is to save life. One of the golden rules of first aid treatment is that you must make sure there is no further danger to the victim or to yourself. First aid treatment is the immediate or temporary help or assistance given to somebody who has been injured or ill before taking him/her to the hospital or the arrival of a doctor.</p>\r\n<h3>First Aid Materials and their Uses</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Plaster: Is used to keep the drug on a wound to stay for a long time and to keep flies off the wound</li>\r\n<li>Penicillin: Applied onto a wound to make it heal faster</li>\r\n<li>Methylated Spirit: Used for cleaning wound before proper medication</li>\r\n<li>Cotton Wool: Used to drain bleeding and to hold drug on wound for some time</li>\r\n<li>Iodine: Used to stop bleeding</li>\r\n<li>Scissors: Used to cut bandages, plaster and to dress wound</li>\r\n<li>Paracetamol: Used to lessen pain, headaches, body fatigues and so on</li>\r\n<li>Bandage: Used to steady dislocated joints</li>\r\n<li>Glucose: Used to recover strength</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Application of Simple First Aid</h3>\r\n<p>The cases of accidents where first aid treatment is used include the following.</p>\r\n<h5>Simple Cuts from Sharp Objects like Knife Which Causes Bleeding</h5>\r\n<p>The bleeding is drained with cotton wool and iodine. Penicillin is applied before covering the wound with plaster.</p>\r\n<h5>Treatment for Burns</h5>\r\n<p>Cover the wound with a sterilized dressing or an adhesive dressing as quickly as possible and send for a doctor.</p>\r\n<h5>Snakebites or Scorpion Stings</h5>\r\n<p>This can be treated by tying a rope on the leg above the bite point. A razor blade is used to make one or two marks on the bite point so that the poison can flow out.</p>\r\n<h5>High Fever</h5>\r\n<p>This can be treated by removing the clothing on the patient. A wet towel is then used on his body to cool down the temperature.</p>\r\n<h5>Chemical Burns</h5>\r\n<p>Flush with cold water immediately and apply sterilized dressing. Alkaline burns are more serious than acid burns and should receive medical attention as soon as possible.</p>\r\n<h5>Drowning</h5>\r\n<p>The victim is made to lie down faced up. His belly is pressed gently to release water through his mouth and nose. If the patient still does not breathe, try a mouth to mouth resuscitation by putting your mouth on his mouth and blowing air into his lungs forcefully.</p>\r\n<h5>Treatment of Electric Shock</h5>\r\n<p>An Electric shock is a sudden painful feeling that a patient gets when electricity passes through one&rsquo;s body. An electric shock is caused by the passage of current through the body causing a paralysis of the muscle particularly the heart muscle. Current as low as 0.02A is fatal. More damage will be caused with longer contact to the source of the current. The severity of an electric shock will depend on:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The voltage of the current source</li>\r\n<li>Moisture or water content of the skin</li>\r\n<li>Proximity of the body to effective earth</li>\r\n<li>Length of time of contact</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Speed is essential in treatment of electric shock as few minutes delay can be the difference between recovery and death. Do not touch the victim with bare hands. First of all, switch off current before attempting to remove the victim using an insulated material like dry wood, dry rope or clothing and so on. Begin artificial respiration mouth-to-mouth method.</p>\r\n<h5>Bleeding and Breaks</h5>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Apply pressure to the bleeding point after dressing for 5 &ndash; 15 minutes. If the wound area is large, press the sides of the wound firmly but gently together.</li>\r\n<li>Lay the casualty down in a suitable and comfortable position and lower the head if possible</li>\r\n<li>Raise the injured part and support it in position unless an underlying fracture is suspected</li>\r\n<li>Carefully remove from the wound any foreign bodies which are visible and can easily be picked out or wiped off with a dressing</li>\r\n<li>Take the victim carefully to a hospital as soon as possible</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h5>Circulation (Pulses)</h5>\r\n<p>The pulse beat is normally taken at the front of the wrist over the radial artery, about 1cm in from the thumb side of the lower end of the forearm. The beat results from the thrust of blood from each contraction of the heart expanding the artery. The pulse may also be taken in other suitable places. The normal adult pulse rate is at least 60-80per minute, the average being 72. In infants and young children, the normal resting rate is much higher, around 90 &ndash; 140 per minute.</p>\r\n<h3>Application of First Aid</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>You must make sure there is no further danger to the casualty or to yourself</li>\r\n<li>Act quickly, quietly and methodically giving priority to the most urgent conditions</li>\r\n<li>Stop bleeding before anything</li>\r\n<li>Watch if breathing has stopped or is failing. If breathing stops, give artificial respiration</li>\r\n<li>If it is a case of poison, make the person to vomit</li>\r\n<li>Do not let the victim to move about until you determine the seriousness of the injury</li>\r\n<li>Do not give liquid drug to an unconscious victim</li>\r\n<li>Control the on-lookers and avoid panicking. Keep assuring the casualty of his safety</li>\r\n<li>Do not allow the casualty to see his own injury</li>\r\n<li>Dress the wound with clean materials</li>\r\n<li>Where it involves fracture, immobilize the affected parts</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>Principle of First Aid</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Do first things first, quickly, quietly and without panic</li>\r\n<li>Make sure that you stop bleeding if there is any</li>\r\n<li>Look for possible injuries and determine whether they are internal or external or both</li>\r\n<li>Give artificial respiration if breathing has stopped</li>\r\n<li>Remove the patient from the cause of injury</li>\r\n<li>Provide fresh air. Remove tie, shoes and loosen belt unless he is an epileptic fellow</li>\r\n<li>Position the casualty correctly</li>\r\n<li>Make use of improvisation materials in bleeding cases such as handkerchief, ties and head ties</li>\r\n<li>Where the injury is extensive, do not allow the casualty to see it</li>\r\n<li>Do not remove clothing unnecessarily</li>\r\n<li>Reassure the casualty of his/her safety in order to lessen his/her anxiety and fear</li>\r\n<li>Before moving the casualty, immobilize fracture and large wounds</li>\r\n<li>Arrange for the careful removal of patient to the hospital</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>Characteristics of a good First Aider</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Highly observant</li>\r\n<li>Gentle, cool, calm and well collected in order not to cause panic</li>\r\n<li>Sympathetic and comforting</li>\r\n<li>Cheerful with a happy expression</li>\r\n<li>Resourceful (making the best use of available resources).</li>\r\n</ul>', 'JSS 2', 'Basic Science', '2021-10-13 13:05:43', '2021-10-13 13:05:43'),

This movement may be linear or rotary movement.</p>\r\n<h4>Belt and Chain Drives</h4>\r\n<p>Belt and chain drives are used for transmitting power and motion. They are used when drive shafts are separated by a large belt and are used in conjunction with pulleys. There is a motor which rotates when it is powered by electricity or gasoline. Therefore transmitting the movement in one part of a machine using a belt or a chain is what is called a bolt and a chain drive.</p>\r\n<p>Examples of machines that use chain drives are sewing machines, pepper and melon grinders (where the belt is between the motor and the main shaft), recorder player, turn table, and the cooling systems (i.e. radiators and air conditioners) or many motor cars. It is not always necessary in all these cases to have slip-free motion of the belt.</p>\r\n<p>The chain drives on the other hand is used when it is necessary to maintain a constant rotation. Common examples of chain drives are found in the bicycles, motorcycles and other motor cars. Many textile and printing machines also use chain drives.</p>\r\n<h3>Applications of Belt and Chain Drives</h3>\r\n<p>Belt drives found useful applications in the following machines: grinding machine, pepper grinder, sewing machines, melon grinders, recorder player, and turn table and so on. While bicycles, motorcycles, motor cars employ chain drives to monitor constant rotation. Many textile and printing machines also use chain drives.</p>\r\n<h4>Advantages of Belt Drives</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Not much heat is generated</li>\r\n<li>It is not expensive</li>\r\n<li>It does not require a lubricant</li>\r\n<li>It is easy to design</li>\r\n<li>Easy to serve and repair</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>Disadvantages of Belt Drives</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>It cannot transmit a heavy load</li>\r\n<li>There is slippage</li>\r\n<li>It cannot do heavy work</li>\r\n<li>It does not last long</li>\r\n<li>Belt has to be changed after a period of time</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>Advantages of Chain Drives</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Not very expensive</li>\r\n<li>Can carry heavy load</li>\r\n<li>Last long</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>Disadvantages of Chain Drives</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Requires longer time to shut down</li>\r\n<li>Needs lubricant which makes it more expensive to maintain</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Wood Work Machines</h3>\r\n<h4>Types and uses</h4>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>Portable Power Tools</strong></li>\r\n<li><strong>Belt Sander:</strong> It is one of the portable sanding machines with an endless belt of cloth backed abrasive which passes over two drums. One of the drum is driven by an electric motor while the other one can be adjusted to ensure an easy rotation of the belt. It is used for smoothing hollow shaped surfaces and edges.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Hand Drill:</strong> Portable electric drill plays an important role in wood workshop as far as portable power tools are concerned. It is used for various forms of drilling.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Fret Saw: </strong>It has fine blade like the coping saw but it has a longer rectangular steel frame. It is used for cutting curves in a very light or soft wood. Its long frame is an advantage because it can cut from a long distance.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Machines</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>Wood work machines were first made with manual operation and developed to steam and gas to electric motor thus making the machine independent of others. These machines can be used to prepare projects quickly and accurately. Such machines include:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>Circular Saw:</strong> This consists of the table, fence, crown guard, saw blade, riving knife, stand, rise and fall, wheel adjustment and the start and stop button. Its primary use is for ripping and deep cutting</li>\r\n<li><strong>Band Saw:</strong> A band saw is the machine counterpart of the fret, coping and bow saws. It is so called because its cutting blade is a narrow strip of metal looped to form a band. The blade is serrated on one side. Basically, it consists of a head supported above a base by means of an upright column. The top of the base supports a flat steel work plate on which the job is placed. The base houses an electric motor, a gear train and a pulley used to cut curves in wood.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Wood Lathe:</strong> A wood lathe is a workshop machine that is employed whenever a job needs to be continuously and rapidly turned while being worked. It is this machine that is used to produce round shaped bowls, round legged poles and other such wooden products. It consists of several parts with the principal ones being the head stock, tail stock and tool rest, bed locking handles, frames and control buttons.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Surface Planer:</strong> A surface Planer shaves the surface of a wooden piece. It is the machine counterpart of hand planes. Depending on the skill of the user, a surface planer can plane accurately and smoothly such that a wood finish can be directly applied on the surface without having to work the surface any further. It consists basically of a base on which is supported a flat, steel work plate. The base houses an electric motor, a gear arrangement and a rotating cylindrical disk. The disk has one or more straight cutting edges somewhere on its curved surface. It is so positioned such that when it rotates, the cutting edges cut through a slot in the steel work plate.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Thicknesser:</strong> A thicknesser is used for planning a wooden piece to a precise thickness. It planes much more finely than a surface planer. Usually, after a surface planer has been used, the job is transferred to a thicknesser so as to plane to precise dimensions. A thicknesser is not much different from a surface planer, being comprised of a base in which is housed an electric motor and gear arrangement, steel work plate which serves as a table and ahead having pressure bars. It has feed rollers which move the wood to the cutters. There are also exit rollers which pass the wood out of the machine. There are two buttons for starting or stopping the operations of the machine. Unlike a surface planer, the top of a thicknesser is not exposed. Wood has to be passed in from underneath.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h4>Functions of Different Types of Machines</h4>\r\n<table>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width=\"139\">\r\n<p><strong>Machines</strong></p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"499\">\r\n<p><strong>Functions</strong></p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width=\"139\">\r\n<p>Circular Saw</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"499\">\r\n<p>Ripping and deep cutting</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width=\"139\">\r\n<p>Band Saw</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"499\">\r\n<p>Rips curves in wood</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width=\"139\">\r\n<p>Wood Lathe</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"499\">\r\n<p>Employed whenever a job being worked needs to be continuously and rapidly turned</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width=\"139\">\r\n<p>Surface Planer</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"499\">\r\n<p>Shaves the surface of a wooden piece</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width=\"139\">\r\n<p>Thicknesser</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"499\">\r\n<p>Planes a wooden piece to precise thickness</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width=\"139\">\r\n<p>Hand Drill</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"499\">\r\n<p>Used for making holes in wood</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width=\"139\">\r\n<p>Belt Sander</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"499\">\r\n<p>Used for smoothing wood</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width=\"139\">\r\n<p>Power Saw</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"499\">\r\n<p>Used for cutting wood of fairly thin thickness</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h4>Care and maintenance of Wood Work Machines</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Do not use a faulty or malfunctioning machine</li>\r\n<li>Switch off machine when it is not being used</li>\r\n<li>Carefully obey instructions specifically governing the operation of individual machines</li>\r\n<li>Do not stay too close to machine and neither bring your hand near the cutting tool of the machine</li>\r\n<li>Do not attempt to operate a machine if you do not know how or are not sure of the way to operate it</li>\r\n<li>Wood work machines must be cleaned and lubricated after use</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h4>Hydraulic and Pneumatic Machines</h4>\r\n<p>Hydraulic and pneumatic machines use similar principles to operate, i.e. the ability of water and air to expand immensely when it is subjected to pressure. For example, when you turn on a tap, water gushes out by the pressure pushing the water from the tank. This principle is also applicable to air which cause a pneumatic action in machine.</p>\r\n<p>Examples of hydraulic machines or devices are hydraulic action, hydraulic ram, garden sprinkler and water wheel. Examples of machines that employ pneumatic principle embrace the following: Single force pump, bicycle pump, car foot pump and centrifugal pump in washing machine.</p>\r\n<h5>Principle behind the Working of Hydraulic and Pneumatic Machines or Devices</h5>\r\n<p>The actual basis of hydraulic action or pneumatic devices is explained by Pascal&rsquo;s law which states that &ldquo;any change of pressure applied to the surface of a confined fluid or gas is transmitted unchanged to all parts of the liquid gas&rdquo;. If piston Q has an area of 4cm<sup>2</sup> and a force of 4N exerted on that piston, the pressure is 1ps. This pressure is then transmitted through the pipe T to Piston O. If the piston O has an area of 40cm<sup>2</sup> then the area is 10 times greater and the force exerted by the air inside the piston O is therefore 10 times as great. The pneumatic machine uses the principle to carry a heavy load.</p>\r\n<h5>Uses of Hydraulic Devices</h5>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Hydraulic jack is used to lift a car up in order to change its tyre</li>\r\n<li>Single force pump is used to push water, oil, gasoline and air from one pump of a pipe to another</li>\r\n<li>Submersible pump is used to pump water from a well to an overhead tank</li>\r\n<li>Hydraulic ram is used to lift a car to a height convenient for an expert to work under the car</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h5>Uses of Pneumatic Devices</h5>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Bicycle pump is used to pump air into the tyre of a bicycle</li>\r\n<li>Centrifuge pump is used to extract water from a working machine</li>\r\n<li>Simple force pump is used to blow air into a bat balloon.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>Gears</h4>\r\n<p>A gear is a toothed wheel which can be used to transmit motion (power). Gearing is the process of using one gear to drive another. Gears use the advantage of friction to transmit motion since a rough surface has to move over another rough surface. Therefore a gear wheel is a wheel with a number of specially shaped projection or serration teeth along its perimeter. Those teeth mesh with corresponding teeth or another wheel to transmit power or motion. Note that the teeth are placed in such a way that they mesh with one another. If we attempt to rotate one of the meshes using the teeth, the other will rotate in the opposite direction.</p>\r\n<p>Gears are used in a varied number of machines and devices and come in various sizes. Mechanical watches, motor vehicle engines, fans, workshop tools and equipment, ships as well as several other devices which involve speed alteration makes use of gears. The most widely used materials for making gears are metals.</p>\r\n<h5>Types of Gear</h5>\r\n<p>Different situations encountered in the course of transmitting power and motion has given rise to distinct types of gears.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Spur Gears: Simple meshing gears having straight teeth and parallel shafts are called spur gears.</li>\r\n<li>Rack and Pinion Gear: When a single spur gear runs along a flat toothed rack, this arrangement is called a rack and pinion gear.</li>\r\n<li>Bevel Gears: When power is to be transmitted between two shafts meeting at right angles, bevel gears are used. A bevel gear consists of teeth made on a frustum of a cone and inclined at an angle to its axis teeth situated on the inside of its rim.</li>\r\n<li>Internal gear: An internal or annular gear has its teeth situated on the inside of its rim.</li>\r\n<li>Planetary gear: A special arrangement of gears called a planetary gear consists of a number of spur gears in meshing contact with one another and another larger gear having internal teeth. They are widely used in automobiles and transport crafts which use propellers.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h5>Use of Gears</h5>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Belt and chain gears are used to transfer motion from part of a machine to another especially heavy parts</li>\r\n<li>Gears are used to transmit drive between two parallel shafts</li>\r\n<li>Gears are used to transfer linear motion to rotary motion</li>\r\n<li>Gears are used for transmitting power/drive between the shafts at angles. These are bevel Gears</li>\r\n<li>Gears are used in selecting speed</li>\r\n<li>Gears are used in changing direction</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h5>Determination of Gear Ratio and Speed Rotation</h5>\r\n<p>Gears are widely used in Engineering for the transmission of power and motion. One gear is attached to the motion while the other is attached to the machinery to be driven. If the driving gear has 20 teeth and the driven gear has 40 teeth, the gear ratio is said to be 2:1. This relationship is true for the speed of the gear i.e. if the driving gear is rotating at a speed of 500rev/min, the driven gear will rotate at 250rev/min.</p>\r\n<h5>Functions of Lubricants in Gears</h5>\r\n<p>The main purpose of lubrication is to reduce friction and wear and tear or rubbing surfaces. Where friction is not wanted, it is desirable to reduce its effects to a minimum. This is done by separating solid surfaces out of effective contact with each other. In order to achieve this, a lubricant is introduced between the two surfaces. Oil or grease which offers little resistance to motion is usually employed in a thin layer. This film of oil reduces effective contact of the surfaces and reduces resistance to motion.</p>', 'JSS 2', 'Basic Science', '2021-10-13 13:05:44', '2021-10-13 13:05:44'),
(88, 11, 'Chapter 11', 'Basic Human Movement', '<h2>TOPIC 11: BASIC HUMAN MOVEMENT</h2>\r\n<h3>Posture and Postural Defects</h3>\r\n<p>Posture is the position the body assumes for a specified movement. It shows proper alignment of body parts when one is working, running, standing and so on. There are good and bad postures.</p>\r\n<p>Good Posture: This simply means the position that requires the least muscular work to bring about movement with grace and poise.</p>\r\n<p>Bad Posture: Bad posture is the posture that puts strain on the muscles, ligaments and bones. Poor posture puts abnormal strain on bones which may lead to deformities referred to as postural defects.</p>\r\n<h4>Postural Defects</h4>\r\n<p>Postural defects occur as a result of non-alignment of body parts, that is, when more pressure is on a part of the body than the others. That is to say that there is no grace and poise in one&rsquo;s movement. There are many postural defects. However, it is important to note that there are true postural problems and there are apparent ones which are as a result of manifestation of growth stage. In the early stages of life, even up to the age of ten years, a child could manifest protruding stomach, knock knees and so on. But as he grows, these manifestations disappear. Other common postural defects include uneven shoulders, lateral curvature (scoliosis), cervical lordosis, hunch back, and lumber lordosis and so on.</p>\r\n<h4>Causes of Postural Problems</h4>\r\n<p>Postural problems, whether true or apparent, are caused by underlying defect of skeletal development or injuries as a result of accident. Sometimes, it results from body muscle imbalance or weakness. Other causes include mental depression, anxiety, poorly fitted shoe, poor nutrition, accident, occupation, fatigue, imitating adults and lack of exercise.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Mental Depression: When people are mentally depressed, their head drop deep in thought. When this continues for a long time there is bound to be a postural problem</li>\r\n<li>Poorly Fitted Shoes: Tightly fitted shoes or oversized shoes will always cause pains to the toes resulting in abnormal movement. This could easily be corrected by wearing well fitted shoes</li>\r\n<li>Poor Nutrition: Good and well-balanced diet is very important for proper development of muscles and bones. Food rich in calcium such as milk are required for proper formation and development of bones and muscles in particular</li>\r\n<li>Accident: Accident is an unexpected mishap. It can happen anytime and anywhere. When it happens, people will be maimed in one way or the other. Some may lose their limbs, the vertebrae column may be affected, and even the hip bone may also be affected leading to one postural problem or the other</li>\r\n<li>Occupation: One&rsquo;s occupation may affect his/her posture. For instance, someone who is always writing is bound to suffer cervical lordosis &ndash; head projected forward or round shoulder</li>\r\n<li>Fatigue: Fatigue means extreme tiredness or exhaustion. It is a temporary inability of the muscular system to perform efficiently. There are different types of fatigue: Physical fatigue and mental fatigue. However, we are only concerned about the physical fatigue as it could cause postural defect. When exhausted, the affected person cannot stand or sit in a good posture. If this continues for a long time, his/her vertebral column could become bent</li>\r\n<li>Imitating Adult: Some children are in the habit of imitating their adult role models in the way they speak, dress, move, sit, run and carry their shoulders. Eventually they end up with an abnormal posture</li>\r\n<li>Lack of Exercise: Lack of exercise can result in any part of the body to be atrophied or weakened resulting in pressure and more work load on other parts of the body. This eventually affects the graceful movement and posture of the individual.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>Explanation of Some Postural Defects as a result of Spine Deformities</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Kyphosis &ndash; Hunchback or Round back: Kyphosis is a spinal curvature in which a large round shape also called the hump at the upper back is prominent. It is also called thoracic hypnosis. This causes the upper vertebrae and the shoulders to tilt forward.</li>\r\n<li>Scoliosis (Lateral Curvature): Scoliosis is a lateral curvature of the spine. Here, the curvature is side to side with one shoulder lowered below the level of the other.</li>\r\n<li>Lumbar Lordosis or Hollow back: Lumbar lordosis is a postural condition in which the lower back sways in causing the stomach to protrude resulting in a hollow at the lumbar region.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>Preventive/Corrective Measures</h4>\r\n<p>No person is ever happy with any part of his/her body deformed be it natural or by accident. To avoid such defects, the following must be adhered to.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Well Planned exercises e.g. sit up, push up, rope climbing, cycling and so on</li>\r\n<li>Well balanced diet rich in calcium and other minerals</li>\r\n<li>Children should be taught the proper way of standing, walking and sitting</li>\r\n<li>Avoid anxiety and depression</li>\r\n<li>Avoid fatigue, however, if it is unavoidable as a result of one&rsquo;s occupation, endeavor to have enough rest after the day&rsquo;s work</li>\r\n<li>Observe break period always.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>Importance of Good Posture</h4>\r\n<p>The importance of proper posture cannot be overemphasized. They include;</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>It is necessary for optimal functioning of the different parts of the body</li>\r\n<li>It gives self-confidence and optimism</li>\r\n<li>Enjoyment of good health depends largely on good posture.</li>\r\n</ul>', 'JSS 2', 'Basic Science', '2021-10-13 13:05:44', '2021-10-13 13:05:44'),

However, recent equipment that detects drug consumption, even if it was taken some days before the competition has been put in place to detect offenders. Taking drugs by youth and adults alike for personal aggrandizement is on the increase and it is not in the interest of the society. Such drugs include caffeine, tobacco, alcohol, cocaine, marijuana and so on. All hands should be on deck to stem this evil tide in our schools, at home and the society at large.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Discrimination against Women</strong>: In the past, women were completely excluded in physical education and sports. Today, there are women professors in physical and health education. Women are there in sports participating in All Africa games, Olympic Games, Commonwealth games and so on.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Physically Challenged</strong>: In the past, physically challenged individuals were not considered fit due to fear and failure. Recently, due to the efforts and concern of physical and health educators, physically challenged persons can participate in many sporting events. They now have their own type of Olympic Games known as Paralympics. This major breakthrough in physical education and sports takes place every four years like the main Olympic Games. It takes place immediately after the Olympic Games in the same venue.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Budget</strong>: The budget of physical and health education and sports has always been looked down upon due to lack of interest of the government. Their lack of interest is in their perception that sports will not produce monetary gain. However, because of the exploits of some soccer players, basketball professionals, volleyball players, boxers, wrestlers, etc. and the presence of some broadminded leaders, the budget of physical and health education and sports has appreciated. Yet, a lot has to be done so as to provide facilities such as standard gymnasia, swimming pools, etc. in higher institutions where physical education is taught.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Challenges of Leadership:</strong> For physical and health education to achieve its ultimate goal i.e. professionalization, the leaders must look for those who have interest and ability in the area. The interest of these fellows will be to develop physical and health education to a standard that coaches, whether soccer, football, basketball, volleyball, boxing, etc., will be specialists in health and physical education. This will help eliminate quacks. Many coaches are not physical educationists. They are there for money and so cannot move the profession forward because one cannot give what one does not have. However, physical and health educators are gradually taking over.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Creativity</strong>: The need for creativity is a major challenge facing physical and health education today. Creativity here means discovery of something that is new. For instance the origination of volleyball by William Morgan in 1895 and the development of basketball by Naismith. Physical education has had very few exciting creative ideas in its history. This is the reason for physical educators to think and come up with vibrant and radical ideas that will help the area grow with the age. This will make physical education more relevant to the rapidly changing world.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Challenge of Mediocrity</strong>: In the past, physical education and sports were regarded as all-comers areas. That is, any person who can play football, soccer, run along tracks and perform various other sports is regarded as a Physical educator. These days things are improving because leaders in physical and health education are now living up to their responsibility.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Challenges of Improving the Curriculum of Physical and Health Education</strong>: Improving the curriculum of physical and health education is a major challenge. As a result, the curriculum remains unchanged for years which are things that shouldn&rsquo;t be happening.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Violence</strong>: This is a behavior that is intended to hurt others physically. Sports violence can be seen as fracas amongst players in the field of play. If not checked may affect the spectators. A number of times, the fans have been seen to engage in fights when their favorite teams did not win. Violence is more prevalent in team sports such as American football, soccer, hockey, basketball, and so on.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h3>Causes of Violence</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>A must win attitude on the part of the players, the coach and the fans</li>\r\n<li>The officials &ndash; mainly the center referee and the assistant referees have decided to take sides with one of the teams. They usually close their eyes to the offences of their preferred team</li>\r\n<li>Unbearable rough plays/tackles by some of the players</li>\r\n<li>In a game like snow hockey, a player can intentionally hit an opponent with his hockey sticks which can cause violence.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Minimizing Violence</h3>\r\n<p>Violence could be minimized in the following ways:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Stress participation and fair play; not winning at all cost</li>\r\n<li>Officials should be well remunerated to avoid bias</li>\r\n<li>Presence of security officials can help maintain order</li>\r\n<li>Stadiums should not be crowded</li>\r\n<li>A player is a player. Color and tribe are immaterial on the field of play</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Marginalization of Blacks and Other Minority Groups by the West</h3>\r\n<p>It was a huge challenge for physical and health education in those days of racism. Blacks and other minority groups were discriminated against. Today, because of the programs of physical and health education and sports, those challenges have been overcome. Incidentally, the blacks that were discriminated against now rule the world of sports.</p>', 'JSS 2', 'Basic Science', '2021-10-13 13:05:44', '2021-10-13 13:05:44'),

This business is tantamount to slavery. Against their will, millions of people around the world are forced to work for the profit of others. Trafficking in persons is a serious crime and gross violation of human rights. Every year, thousands of men women and children fall into the hand of traffickers in their own countries and abroad. These unfortunate human beings are subjected to prostitution, begging, working in sweatshops and other forms of dehumanizing activities.</p>\r\n<h3>How Does Trafficking Happen</h3>\r\n<p>Young women are usually fascinated when they are promised a good job with a fat pay packet. In most cases, they use force, threat, coercion, abduction, fraud and deception. On arrival at their destination, their passports, visas and return tickets are taken from them and they are forced to do any manner of work they are asked to do. Even the money they earn is not given to them.</p>\r\n<h3>Causes of Trafficking</h3>\r\n<p>The major causes of trafficking include:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>Poverty</strong>: Some people around the world are living in abject poverty to the extent that they cannot boast of a good meal a day. This could be caused by poor family planning on the part of the parents, the death of one or both of the parents, crime, diseases, famine, war and natural disasters</li>\r\n<li><strong>Some People Derive Pleasure in Exploitation</strong>: Women and children are ready markets for traffickers</li>\r\n<li>Lack of contentment</li>\r\n<li>Laziness</li>\r\n<li>Easy money on the part of the traffickers and their victims</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h3>Health Implication of Trafficking</h3>\r\n<p>The act of trafficking and the attendant human right violations can have very serious consequences for the victim.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Women who are subjected to these inhuman treatments can suffer from physical and mental problems such as physical abuse, exhaustion and starvation</li>\r\n<li>They can suffer from severe injuries such as broken bones, bruises or burns</li>\r\n<li>At times, they contract sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) including HIV/AIDS</li>\r\n<li>Sometimes they suffer severe stress and depression</li>\r\n<li>Those of them in the sex trade face the risk of unwanted pregnancy and miscarriages thereby endangering their health</li>\r\n<li>They also suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder and anxiety. In extreme cases may lead to self-mutation or even suicide</li>\r\n<li>Some have even gone mad</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Solution to Human Trafficking</h3>\r\n<p>From all indications, the key countries where this illicit trade is going on are paying lip service to the whole saga. They know what to do.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Slave trade/human trafficking should be criminalized</li>\r\n<li>Wars should be avoided and poverty should be tackled</li>\r\n<li>People should be contented with what they have.

Some authorities said it originated in China. Others said it originated in USA, yet others said it started in England. All the same, the game was made popular by the USA. Originally, the game was known as a parlor game. After some years, the rules were standardized and it became a popular sport. It is played in almost every nation of the world today. The equipment in table tennis includes the table, the bat, the net and the ball.</p>\r\n<h3>Basic Skills and Techniques</h3>\r\n<p><strong>The Grip:</strong> Grip in table tennis is very important because a good and proper grip ensures good service and stroke. There are two types of grip; the forehand grip and the backhand grip. In the forehand or handshake grip, the right hand enters into the handle of the bat as if to shake hands with it. The thumb faces the left hand and the index finger, the right. The rest of the fingers curl around the handle of the bat. In the backhand grip, the side gripped by the index finger faces the table.</p>\r\n<p><strong>The Service: </strong>The server stands a little distance away from his own area of the table with the ball on his left palm. As soon as his opponent is ready, he tosses the ball up and hits the ball down on his own side of the table before it crosses to the opponent&rsquo;s side.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Let:</strong> This means that the service should be retaken either because the opponent was not ready when the first service was made or the served ball touched the top of the net before touching the opponent&rsquo;s side of the table.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Strokes:</strong> Strokes are of two types: Offensive strokes and defensive strokes. Offensive strokes include the forehand drive, backhand drive and the smash while the defensive strokes include the backhand chop and the forehand chop. Strokes are meant to dislodge an opponent so that he will not be able to return the ball.</p>\r\n<h3>Gymnastics and Aerobics</h3>\r\n<p>Gymnastics and aerobics make use of creative rhythms in order to bring out the beauty of the sports. The origin of the sport could be traced back to ancient Greece but modern gymnastics is the brainchild of the Germans. Gymnastics refers to activities that are performed in a gymnasium. It is the art of performing various types of physical exercises and uncommon feats of skill. It could be classified in to two broad headings; floor activities and apparatus work.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Floor Activities:</strong> Floor activities are gymnastic activities performed on the floor. They are divided into two &ndash; stunt and tumbling. Stunt includes exercises such as wheel barrow, frog jump, rabbit jump, duck walk, crab walk, duck fight and cat crawl. Tumbling involves exercises such as forward roll, backward roll, head stand, head spring, hand spring, cat spring and somersault.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Apparatus Work</strong>: These are activities performed on apparatus such as parallel bar, beam bar, climbing rope, balance beams and chinning bars. Activities on these apparatus include: Through vault, astride vault, rope climbing, pull up, chin up, gate vault, thief vault and neck spring vault.</p>\r\n<h4>Importance of Gymnastics</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The gymnast enjoys a flexible body</li>\r\n<li>He enjoys self confidence</li>\r\n<li>His movement is always with grace and poise</li>\r\n<li>His agility and alertness are enhanced</li>\r\n<li>His economy is improved</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Aerobics</h3>\r\n<p>Aerobic is a form of physical exercise that combines rhythmic exercise with stretching and strength training routines with the goal of improving all elements of fitness such as flexibility, muscular strength and cardiovascular fitness. This is usually performed to music and may be practiced in a group setting. Another goal of aerobics is to prevent illness and promote physical fitness.</p>\r\n<h4>Types of Dance Activities</h4>\r\n<p>Dance simply means an art that involves movement of the whole body. It is performed in many cultures of the world as a form of emotional expression, social interaction or exercise. Dance sometimes is use to express idea or tell a story. Dance activities can be classified into singing games, cultural or folk dance and creative dance.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Singing Games: </strong>Singing game is a dance where people sing a song and dance according to the beat. An example is fire on the mountain and Kpu Kpu Ogele. It is one of the simplest forms of dance.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Cultural or Folk Dances:</strong> These are traditional dances found in a particular culture or tribe or group. They are contemporary dances of the past and present of a people.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Creative Dance:</strong> Creative dances are movements people make to communicate their feeling about certain things and ideas. Creative dances can only be possible when a child has sufficient movement skill and vocabulary.</p>', 'JSS 2', 'Basic Science', '2021-10-13 13:05:45', '2021-10-13 13:05:45'),

The game was introduced in the USA by Mary Outer bridge. The game came to West African countries including Nigeria through the missionaries. By 1936, Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe had established Lawn Tennis club in Lagos. The Nigerian Lawn Tennis Association (NLTA) is the governing body of the game.</p>\r\n<h3>Basic Skills and Techniques</h3>\r\n<p><strong>The Grip:</strong> There are two types of grip.</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>Shake hand or the Eastern Grip</strong>: In this case, the index finger and the thumb form a &lsquo;V&rsquo; shape on the narrow side of the handle of the racket. This is called the learner&rsquo;s grip, used mainly for forehand drive.</li>\r\n<li><strong>The Service or Continual Grip</strong>: Here, the player holds the racket at the throat with his left hand, for a right handed player, twists a little inwards. This type of grip is for service.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p><strong>The Forehand Drive</strong>: This is the skill that is used to return the ball that is on the right hand to an opponent.</p>\r\n<p><strong>The Backhand Drive: </strong>This is the skill that is used to return the ball that is on the left hand to an opponent.</p>\r\n<p><strong>The Service:</strong> This is the act of putting the ball into play or starting a game. Here, the server calls the attention of the receiver before delivering the ball. A good service must have the following qualities:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>It must be delivered to the appropriate part of the opponent&rsquo;s side of the court</li>\r\n<li>It must not touch the top of the net before touching the opponent&rsquo;s side of the court</li>\r\n<li>The attention of the receiver must be drawn</li>\r\n<li>Service must be delivered from behind the end line</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>The Volley and Half Volley</strong>: In volley, the ball is sent back to the opponent before it touches the ground. The ball is struck back to the sender before it bounces on the ground. In half volley, the ball is struck as it is about to rise from a bounce. Volley is an offensive skill while half volley is a defensive skill.</p>\r\n<p><strong>The Smash/Overhead Smash</strong>: This is the act of striking an overhead ball or a lob down into the opponent&rsquo;s court with a strong force. Care should be taken not to miss the ball out of anxiety.</p>\r\n<p><strong>The Lob: </strong>A lob is a strike that has a good trajectory into the opponent&rsquo;s court.

The height of the net at the center is 0.91m and is held in place by two strong posts with the help of a metal cable. The longer part of the court is the side line while the shorter side is the baseline. The center line is midway the baseline.</p>\r\n<p><strong>The Ball: </strong>The lawn tennis ball is constructed in such a way that it can bounce properly on touching the ground. It has a diameter of 0.6 &ndash; 0.67cm with a weight of about 58.5 grams. The players usually wear white shorts and white polo with canvas shoes.</p>\r\n<p><strong>The Game: </strong>The game is started with a service from the right hand side of the baseline of the side that won the toss. A call must be made to draw the attention of the receiver. The game can be played by two players: that is, a player aside (singles) or four players &ndash; two players aside (doubles). There is also the mixed doubles in which case a man and a woman aside.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Scoring:</strong> In the game of tennis, either side can make a point during rally. The first point is 15, the second point is 30, and the third point is 40. If the two sides score 40-40 it is called a deuce. At this point, a player has to score two consecutive points. If the serving side makes a point after deuce, it is called &ldquo;advantage in&rdquo; but if it is the non-serving side that gets the point, it is called &ldquo;advantage out&rdquo;.

The physical education teacher should not, as a result of fear of injury, deny the children these programs. The only thing the teacher should do is to be safety conscious. These include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Playground and gymnasium should be in good condition. Defective equipment should be repaired or replaced immediately</li>\r\n<li>Competent supervisors and instructors should be employed to handle the students</li>\r\n<li>There should be medical examination to ascertain the student&rsquo;s level of fitness before participation</li>\r\n<li>Jumping into physical activity without adequate warm up can be dangerous. So warm up is important to free the muscles, reduce friction in joints and help reduce injury in sports.</li>\r\n<li>The interest, physical and emotional development of the young people must be considered</li>\r\n<li>The child should be exposed to activities appropriate to their skill.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Safety Measures on the Road</strong>: The different categories of people that use the road are the motorists, the pedestrian, the cyclist, the motor cyclist, and the traffic wardens.

Sports injuries include the following:</p>\r\n<p><strong>Sprain</strong>: A sprain is an injury to a joint in which one or more ligaments that support the joint are over-stretched or even torn. Sprain is usually caused by violent twist of the joint while in motion. Parts of the body that are commonly sprained include the knee, ankle, wrist and fingers. Signs of sprain are severe pain, swelling at the joint, tender to touch, black and blue discoloration and difficulty in using that joint.</p>\r\n<p><strong>First Aid Treatment for Sprain:</strong> The first aider should do the following:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Immobilize the sprained part of the body using the bandage carefully so as not to also suffocate blood circulation</li>\r\n<li>Apply cold compress to reduce pain and swelling</li>\r\n<li>The victim must not use the sprained part until the doctor allows it</li>\r\n<li>The injured part should be in a sling.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Strain</strong>: Strain is an injury in the muscle or any other part of the body due to over use. This is especially caused by lack of warm-up exercise. Signs of strain include muscle tear, muscle stiffness and pain.</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>First Aid Treatment for Strain</strong>: The first aider should do the following:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Rest the strained part in a comfortable bed</li>\r\n<li>Apply cold compress</li>\r\n<li>Strap the affected region</li>\r\n<li>Apply hot compress after some time.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Dislocation: </strong>This is a displacement of one of the bones that form a joint. In dislocation, the ligaments and fibrous capsule that hold the joint are over-stretched and torn. This could be caused by a blow on the affected part. Some of the signs of dislocation are difficulty in movement or no movement at all, excruciating pain and swelling of the affected region.</p>\r\n<p><strong>First Aid Treatment for Dislocation</strong>: The first aider should do the following:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Immobilize the affected part of the body</li>\r\n<li>Apply cold compress on the affected part</li>\r\n<li>Do not try to push it into place</li>\r\n<li>Send the victim to a doctor.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Fracture</strong>: Fracture is a break in the bone. Fracture can happen in any part of the body where there are bones. It could be caused by a fall, automobile accident and so on. There are three major types of fracture namely: Greenstick fracture, simple fracture and compound fracture. There could be multiple fractures in which case a particular bone is broken in more than one place. Some of the signs of fracture are the inability to use the fractured part, discoloration on the affected part, pains, swelling, tenderness at the fractured part and the broken can be felt.</p>\r\n<p><strong>First Aid Treatment for Fracture</strong>: The first aider should do the following:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Immobilize the fractured part</li>\r\n<li>Apply cold compress if the skin is not badly torn</li>\r\n<li>Control bleeding if the skin is torn and blood is gushing out</li>\r\n<li>Reassure the victim</li>\r\n<li>Send the victim to the doctor</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Bruise: </strong>Bruises are injuries inside the body tissue; the skin may not be torn. In this case, the small blood vessels are broken in the bruised tissues and blood escapes into these tissues causing it to swell and become dark. It could be caused by a blow from a hard object. Some of the signs of bruises include swelling, pain and black discoloration as the affected area heals.</p>\r\n<p><strong>First Aid Treatment for Bruise</strong>: The first aider should do the following:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Apply cold compress</li>\r\n<li>If the hand or feet is bruised, dip repeatedly in ice water for a few minutes and remove</li>\r\n<li>Put the bruised part in a sling to rest it</li>\r\n<li>The following day apply hot and cold compress for fast healing.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Wounds: </strong>Wounds consist of a break in the skin which affects the tissues and muscles and may or may not affect the bone. Wounds may be closed or open. A wound is closed when there is no visible break on the skin. It is an open wound when there is visible break on the skin and blood is gushing out. There are different types of wounds as follows:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>Abrasion</strong>: This is caused by friction between a hard and rough surface and the skin resulting to the removal of the first layer of the skin</li>\r\n<li><strong>Lacerated Wound</strong>: this is caused by a rough and hard object leaving a jagged cut on the skin</li>\r\n<li><strong>Punctured Wound</strong>: It is a puncture of the skin by a sharp pointed object like needles, pins and so on.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Incised Wound</strong>: This type of wound is usually caused by sharp objects such as razor blade and knives causing blood to gush out.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p><strong>First Aid Treatment for Wounds</strong>: The first aider should do the following:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Arrest bleeding using direct pressure</li>\r\n<li>Control pressure points nearest to the wound to reduce flow of blood to the site</li>\r\n<li>Wash wound with sterile water and soap</li>\r\n<li>Wash the skin around the mouth of the wound</li>\r\n<li>Use clean water to flush out any dirt inside the wound</li>\r\n<li>The first aider should not administer any medicine to the victim</li>\r\n<li>Take the victim to the doctor</li>\r\n</ul>', 'JSS 2', 'Basic Science', '2021-10-13 13:05:45', '2021-10-13 13:05:45'),

(95, 18, 'Chapter 18', 'Road Accidents', '<h2>TOPIC 18: ROAD ACCIDENTS</h2>\r\n<p>It has been observed that road accidents have claimed more lives than all diseases put together. There are three main causes of accidents namely: The human factor, mechanical factor and environmental factor.</p>\r\n<p><strong>The Human Factor</strong>: Some of the human factors that cause road accidents are:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Over speeding</li>\r\n<li>Driving when tired</li>\r\n<li>Driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs</li>\r\n<li>Driving a faulty vehicle</li>\r\n<li>Dangerous overtaking</li>\r\n<li>Entertaining distractions while driving</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Mechanical Factor</strong>: These are factors that cause road accident as a result of the poor state of the vehicle. Some of these include tire burst, brake failure, poor steering power, incessant engine problem, smoke from exhaust pipe hindering the vision of the driver, poor lighting system, Absence of rear mirror and non-functional horn.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Environmental Factor</strong>: Environmental factors entail everything around the vehicle. They include things such as:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Potholes along the road</li>\r\n<li>Meandering road</li>\r\n<li>Absence of road markings</li>\r\n<li>Heavy rain and poor drainage systems</li>\r\n<li>Slippery surface as a result of spillage on the road</li>\r\n<li>Debris or blockages on the road</li>\r\n<li>Absence of road signs</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>First Aid</strong>: When a road accident occurs, it is important to know what to do to save life that will otherwise have been lost.

(96, 19, 'Chapter 19', 'Personal, School and Community Health', '<h2>TOPIC 19: PERSONAL, SCHOOL AND COMMUNITY HEALTH</h2>\r\n<p>School health program could be referred to as that part of health education learned at school which influences the behavior of the child and school personnel health wise. For example, prevention of diseases and what to do when someone falls ill suddenly.</p>\r\n<h3>Importance of School Health Program</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>To acquaint the students with the health hazards inherent in the society</li>\r\n<li>To promote good health practice among the students school personnel and by extension, parents and sibling</li>\r\n<li>To help the student and all around them develop positive attitudes towards health</li>\r\n<li>To expose some superstitious beliefs and cultural barriers to health practices.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Components of School Health Programs</h3>\r\n<p>For school health program to achieve its objectives, the under listed areas should be handled and covered by professionals.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Health instruction</li>\r\n<li>School health services</li>\r\n<li>Healthy living and environment</li>\r\n<li>School, home and community relationship</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>Health Instruction</h4>\r\n<p>Health instruction is the aspect of health education that has to do with day-to-day teaching and learning of desirable health knowledge. This should also include: involving the students in the planning and conduct of healthy school living and health services. Students should be involved in sanitation i.e. cleaning the school compound and disposal of refuse, supervising the activities of food vendors, gathering information about health states of fellow students and reporting same to the school authorities. Health instruction should not be an all classroom affair only.</p>\r\n<h4>School Health Service</h4>\r\n<p>This is a design to determine the health status of the pupil, student and school personnel so as to identify any defects. It also involves making ways of presenting diseases known to the child and parents. It helps the teacher to detect early enough signs and symptoms of diseases and render emergency care. In summary, the activity under this heading can be divided into two broad groups.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The simple and the ones that can be readily observed either by the teacher or the students. These include: Gait and posture, vision problem, height and weight, skin problems, paleness and so on.</li>\r\n<li>Those that can be handled by professionals in the medical field. These include hernia, appendectomy &ndash; removal of appendix through operation, or any other case that requires opening of the body.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>Healthy School Living/Healthy School Environment</h4>\r\n<p>Healthy school environment is essential since the child spends approximately eight hours in school every school day. The under listed make for a healthy school environment.</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>Good water supply</strong>: Pipe borne water, preferably, should be provided in the school. In rural areas where the provision of safe and potable water is difficult, parents and teachers should make it a priority. In the absence of pipe borne water through boreholes, big water containers with taps should be mounted in the school to provide safe and potable water to the children. This serves useful purposes which include drinking, bathing and flushing of toilets.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Good toilet system and restroom</strong>: Quite a good number of conveniences and urinals should be provided depending on the number of pupils. There should be adequate supply of water and wash hand basin for the students to wash their hands and flush the toilets. These conveniences should be properly guarded to avoid abuse.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Good lighting and ventilation</strong>: Bright light is very important for reading so a standard classroom should have four long fluorescent tubes to give the room proper illumination. The same thing is applicable to ventilation. A standard classroom should have four big windows with two on either side. This allows for free flow of air in and out of the classroom.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Suitable chairs and desks</strong>: Moveable seats and desks are better than the ones built together because the height of the children differs. The desk should be high to allow free movement of the child&rsquo;s thigh. The desk should not be too high or too low, too near or too far from each other to avoid any form of postural defect such as hunchback.</li>\r\n<li><strong>First aid box</strong>: Since injuries and sudden ill health can occur anytime in the school, it is pertinent to have a well-equipped first aid kit. Teachers and senior students should have knowledge of first aid in order to assist in case of emergency.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Safe playground</strong>: The playground should be big enough to accommodate all sporting or gymnastic activities the students will be engaged in. They must be located within the school premises and must be free from stumps, sharp objects and so on.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Good location</strong>: Good location of a school ensures a measure of safety for the child and relative peace on the part of the parents. In view of the above, schools should be located away from hustling and bustling areas to avoid distraction. It must not be too far from the child&rsquo;s home. It should be fenced with one gate manned by gate men.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h4>School &ndash; Home and Community Relationship</h4>\r\n<p>School &ndash; home and community relationship has to do with the health practices in the school, at home and the community at large.</p>\r\n<p>Community health encompasses the practice of preventing diseases, prolonging life and promoting health and wellbeing through organized community effort for the sanitation of the environment, the control of communicable infection/chronic conditions, the organization of medical and nursing services for the early diagnosis and prevention of diseases, the education of the individual in personal health and the development of social machinery to ensure everyone a standard of living adequate for the maintenance or improvement of health.</p>\r\n<p>In civilized communities, doctors and nurses plus health and physical education professionals may decide to come together to form a team which will work with the school personnel, students, families and community based organizations in order to improve the overall health of the community. Such areas as immunization, regular cleaning and sweeping of roads in the community, regular inspection of families to ensure good drinking water, good and clean toilet system, planting of flowers and trees for beautification and fresh air and so on. The team should cover such areas as:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Construction of solid building to ensure durability and good ventilation</li>\r\n<li>Organizing lectures for pregnant and nursing mothers covering such topics as child care and family planning</li>\r\n<li>For the youths, topics such as prevention of premarital sex, abortion, unwanted pregnancy, communicable diseases such as gonorrhea, syphilis, HIV/AIDs and Ebola should be covered to augment the efforts of the school.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Pollution</h3>\r\n<p>Pollution could be defined as the introduction of contaminants into natural environment thereby making the environment inhabitable.</p>\r\n<h4>Environmental Pollution</h4>\r\n<p>This means the contamination of an environment by pollutants such as chemicals, heat, noise and any other thing that can impact the environment negatively. The advent of technology has brought with it a lot of changes in the environment. Thick forests that produce fresh oxygen are now replaced by industries that produce carbon (II) oxide. Environmental pollution is of different types. They include water pollution, soil pollution, air pollution, noise pollution and radioactive pollution.</p>\r\n<h4>Water Pollution</h4>\r\n<p>When contaminants enter any body of water like a river, lake, sea, stream, lakes and so on, the water becomes polluted. These contaminants in most cases are introduced into the water through human activities in the home, industry, agriculture, cooling stations and atomic reactors.</p>\r\n<p>Pollutants from the home include waste water from toilets, kitchens, bathrooms and so on. If a river is suffocated by these wastes, there may be shortage of oxygen which affects aquatic life.</p>\r\n<p>Industrial wastes such as oil, detergents and metals amongst others can pollute water bodies and render it unusable.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Agricultural Pollutants: </strong>Poultry dung, urine and dropping from cattle at times find their way to the river or stream making water bad for human use.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Cooling Stations and Atomic Reactor: </strong>Power plants and atomic reactors cool their plants with water which flows back to the body of water increasing the temperature and causing thermal pollution. Thermal pollution is an increase in the water temperature due to industrial operations.</p>\r\n<h5>Effect or Dangers of Water Pollution</h5>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Aquatic life may be in jeopardy and at times face out right extinction if no proper attention is given.</li>\r\n<li>The source of water for human consumption is lost</li>\r\n<li>Fishes, shell fish such as lobsters, crabs, oysters which are the major sources of iodine for humans will be lost</li>\r\n<li>Lakes, streams and sometimes rivers which serve as recreational facilities may be stinking as a result of pollution.</li>\r\n<li>Water pollution can affect human health when pollutants enter the body through the skin or direct consumption of contaminated water or food. This will result to water borne diseases such as cholera, typhoid, and dysentery.</li>\r\n<li>Hot water discharged from power plants usually change the level of oxygen dissolved in a body of water. This in effect disrupts the water&rsquo;s ecological balance leading to the death of some plants and animals in the system</li>\r\n<li>All water pollutants are hazardous to humans and other living things</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h5>Prevention and Control of Water Pollution</h5>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Technological development has made possible the treatment of sewage before discharging it into the water bodies. So it is important to treat sewage to destroy pathogenic organisms in the sewage.</li>\r\n<li>Wastes from industries should be channeled to covered ditches or pits as is the practice in civilized countries</li>\r\n<li>The use of excess fertilizer and pesticides should be discouraged</li>\r\n<li>Waste food materials, papers, decaying vegetables and plastics should be disposed properly</li>\r\n<li>Effluents from distilleries and solid wastes containing organic matters should be sent to biogas plants for generation of energy</li>\r\n<li>Streams, lakes, rivers and other water bodies around where oil is produces should be protected from bunkering activities to avoid spillage.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>Soil Pollution</h4>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Soil pollution also known as hard pollution can simply be defined as contamination of the soil. This takes two forms namely: deforestation and dumping of solid wastes.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Deforestation</strong>: This involves cutting or burning down all trees in a particular area. This causes soil erosion. Erosion can be brought about by two agents namely: wind (wind erosion) and water (water erosion). When the top soil is eroded, the eco system is distorted causing the soil to be polluted.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Dumping of Solid Wastes</strong>: Dumping of solid wastes from homes and industries pollute the land and enhance degradation. Such solid wastes include rubber, paper, plastic, fabric, leather, glass and so on. Some harmful pesticides and excessive use of fertilizer in agriculture contaminate the soil by increasing the soil acidity which destroys important organisms in the soil. This creates an imbalance in the soil and also prevents natural growth of plants. Oil spillage is the worst of all forms of soil pollution. It renders the soil useless because every living thing in the area dies. Most farm land in some oil producing states such as Rivers, Delta and so on has been lost to oil spillage.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h5>Dangers of Soil Pollution</h5>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Heaps of solid waste destroy the natural beauty of an area</li>\r\n<li>It breeds rodents, flies, mosquitoes, and so on from where they invade homes.</li>\r\n<li>The stench that comes out from the site pollutes the area</li>\r\n<li>Wastes may also block the flow of water in drainage systems which results to flooding</li>\r\n<li>Water from the solid waste site may find its way to a nearby stream or river and pollute it.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h5>Control of Soil Pollution</h5>\r\n<p>Soil pollution can be controlled if the following are put in place.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Enforcement of better ways of refuse disposal which will include provision of incinerators, refuse recycling plants, and so on.</li>\r\n<li>Indiscriminate felling of trees and burning of forest reserves should be prohibited by governments. This is because plants provide protective cover on the land to prevent soil erosion.</li>\r\n<li>Government should provide well-constructed drainage systems in every city to avoid flooding</li>\r\n<li>Soil erosion which is an aspect of pollution should be controlled by the use of contour ploughing and wind breaks</li>\r\n<li>Grass should be allowed to grow on any unused land</li>\r\n<li>Over grazing should be avoided</li>\r\n<li>Intensive cropping and planting of trees should be encouraged</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>Air Pollution</h4>\r\n<p>Air pollution can be defined as contamination of the air. It is caused by harmful substances in the air. Two main factors contribute to air pollution. They are automotive pollution and thermal power plants/industries.</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>Automotive Pollution</strong>: This type of air pollution happens as a result of increased number of vehicles on our roads. These vehicles emit gases that are harmful to the body. In the atmosphere, there are various gases having a certain amount of percentage. Any type of interference in the equilibrium of the gases becomes air pollution.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Thermal Power Plants/Industries</strong>: These industries that are involved in the production of cement, steel, mines, petrochemicals and so on push into the atmosphere harmful solid substances such as dust, soot and radioactive materials which are not only harmful to man but also deplete the ozone layer which protects living things from the direct rays of the sun.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h5>Sources of air pollution can be grouped under the following</h5>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Natural sources which include forest fire, volcanic ashes, dust storm, decays of organic materials and so on.</li>\r\n<li>Manmade sources which include deforestation, urbanization and industrialization.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h5>Effect of Air Pollution</h5>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Mammals take in oxygen and breathe out carbon dioxide. When this oxygen is polluted by things like dust, lead oxide, sulphur dioxide and so on, there is bound to be deposits in the lungs. These deposits may result in bronchitis, lung cancer, asthma and so on.</li>\r\n<li>Carbon monoxide emitted from vehicles affect the nervous system</li>\r\n<li>Skin cancer can result from radiation due to direct sun rays, This can only happen when the ozone layer is depleted as it is today</li>\r\n<li>Radiation causes quite a number of damages to the body such as eye problem and destruction of immune system</li>\r\n<li>Acid rain caused by the presence of oxides of nitrogen and sulphur in the air which form nitric acid and sulphuric acid respectively damage monuments, buildings and statues due to the presence of acid in the rain water.</li>\r\n<li>Acid rain also increases soil acidity which affects agricultural productivity.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h5>Prevention and Control of Air Pollution</h5>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Combustion &ndash; when organic pollutants are burnt, they become less harmful</li>\r\n<li>Vehicles should be properly maintained to prevent pollution</li>\r\n<li>Use of better designed equipment and smokeless fuels at home and in industries</li>\r\n<li>Use of electrostatic precipitators</li>\r\n<li>Plant trees. Trees absorb carbon dioxide and filter out air pollutants</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>Noise Pollution</h4>\r\n<p>Noise pollution is any kind of sound that is unpleasant to the ear. Usually, it is always loud and hard. Noise pollution will always constitute a nuisance to the environment. There are two main sources of noise pollution. These are natural sources and artificial sources.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Natural Sources</strong>: The things that constitute noise pollution naturally include volcanic eruption, wind at very high speed, fall from a big tree and any other loud and unpleasant noise that could occur without the interference of man.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Artificial Sources</strong>: Artificial sources of noise pollution are numerous due to man&rsquo;s activities. Some of them include factories, industries, explosives, automobile, trains and so on.</p>\r\n<h5>Effect of Noise Pollution</h5>\r\n<p>An unwanted and unpleasant sound is a disturbance to people around that environment. In like manner, prolonged exposure to high level of noise is very harmful to hearing. Research work or reading generally cannot take place in a noisy atmosphere. It brings restlessness and confusion. No meaningful work can be done in a noise polluted area.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Control of Noise pollution</strong></li>\r\n<li>Noise pollution in factories, industries and so on can be controlled by muffling the source of sound</li>\r\n<li>Protective equipment should be provided for factory workers</li>\r\n<li>Physical barriers such as vertical walls and trees reduce noise pollution considerably particularly in industries, factories and along highways.</li>\r\n</ul>', 'JSS 2', 'Basic Science', '2021-10-13 13:05:46', '2021-10-13 13:05:46'),
(97, 20, 'Chapter 20', 'Non-Communicable Diseasees and Their Prevention', '<h2>TOPIC 20: NON-COMMUNICABLE DISEASES AND THEIR PREVENTION</h2>\r\n<p>Non-communicable diseases are diseases that one cannot contract by having contact with an infected person. The carrier cannot pass them to a healthy person. They are not contagious and cannot be passed from person to person. People of all ages are vulnerable to these diseases as long as they are exposed to those factors that cause them.</p>\r\n<p>Because of the socioeconomic impacts of non-communicable diseases on families and the society, it is important to control or if possible prevent the spread. There are quite a number of non-communicable diseases including those caused by food nutrient deficiency such as rickets, beriberi, kwashiorkor, goiter, etc. However, there are others that are not connected with food nutrient deficiency such as obesity, asthma, anemia, sickle cell, cancer, heart disease, etc.</p>\r\n<h3>Sickle Cell Disease</h3>\r\n<p>Sickle cell is a hereditary disease (passed from parent to child before the child is born). It is caused by the production of abnormal types of red blood cells which have sickle shape instead of the normal round shape of cells. The disadvantage of this sickle or crescent shaped red blood cells is that because of their shape they do not pass through the small blood vessels easily and may at times block the blood supply to vital organs of the body such as the brain, kidney, heart, and so on. If there is blockage in the coronary artery, that is, the artery that supplies blood to the walls of the heart, heart attack may result.</p>\r\n<p>The sickle shaped red blood cells also have reduced hemoglobin content thereby reducing oxygen content of the cell which affects the quantity of energy liberated in the body. This accounts for the tiredness experienced by sickle cell patients most of the time. The disease is not contagious.</p>\r\n<h4>Symptoms of Sickle Cell Disease</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Abdominal pain</li>\r\n<li>Severe leg cramp</li>\r\n<li>Yellowish discoloration of the eyes</li>\r\n<li>Pain in the bone</li>\r\n<li>Feverish condition</li>\r\n<li>Anemia</li>\r\n<li>In severe case, chronic ulcer of the leg may occur</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>Prevention/Control</h4>\r\n<p>The only way to prevent this disease is by discouraging people who are carriers from marrying themselves. However, if it is ascertained that a person has sickle cell disease, it is advisable to follow the under listed instructions to reduce incessant crisis.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Eating highly nutritious food particularly those rich in protein</li>\r\n<li>Avoid strenuous exercises such as sprinting, climbing, playing football</li>\r\n<li>Take patient to the doctor when there is crisis</li>\r\n<li>Blood transfusion is necessary.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Obesity</h3>\r\n<p>Obesity can be defined as excessive body fats in the body. This is largely due to over eating. Obesity is one of the major health problems of this age because of the nature of the food that is consumed. Presently, in our markets and food stores, there are many appetizing foodstuffs with high fat content. Adults and young people alike eat them even in-between meals regardless of their fat content. Continuous voracious intake of this type of food stuffs without corresponding exercises or coupled with a lot of inactivity may result to obesity. The danger of this disease is that the victim stands the risk of developing diabetes, heart diseases and other complications.</p>\r\n<h4>Prevention</h4>\r\n<p>The following can prevent obesity in both old and young people. They include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Well regulated exercises</li>\r\n<li>Avoid eating in-between meals</li>\r\n<li>Avoid eating fatty foods</li>\r\n<li>Consumption of lean meat, vegetables and fruits is encouraged</li>\r\n<li>Overeating should be avoided</li>\r\n<li>Sedentary jobs without exercise can result to obesity so exercises are very important for sedentary workers</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Asthma (Bronchial Asthma)</h3>\r\n<p>Asthma is one of the respiratory diseases characterized by narrowing of the air passages such as the trachea, bronchi, and so on. This disease causes an interference with the passage of air through the branches. This interference is largely due to congestion brought about by mucus. The result of this congestion is difficulty in expelling air than drawing in air. In an asthmatic patient, the bronchi and the bronchiole become swollen and congested with mucus.</p>\r\n<h4>Causes</h4>\r\n<p>Bronchiole asthma is caused by some allergens such as dusty atmosphere, smoke, and pollen grains from flowers and crops; others include animal hairs such as dogs, goats, cats, some chemicals, emotional stress, worry, cold temperature, nitrogen oxide, high humidity and so on. When a person with asthma inhales an allergen which that person is sensitive to, the bronchi and the bronchiole constrict triggering off a type of reaction resulting in difficulty in breathing. This is clinically referred to as asthmatic attack. Asthma limits the social life of its patient because people with asthma are afraid of going to places where they may be exposed to an allergen they are sensitive to.</p>\r\n<p>Symptoms of asthma are coughing, wheezing, short breath, chest tightness, noisy breathe.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h4>Prevention/Control</h4>\r\n<p>Asthma attacks can be prevented or minimized in several ways which include the following:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Avoidance of allergens such as dust, paints, pollen grains from flowers and crops, hair from dogs, goats, worries, emotional stress.</li>\r\n<li>Adhering strictly to the doctor&rsquo;s instruction on medication which include having one&rsquo;s inhaler always in one&rsquo;s pocket.</li>\r\n<li>Pregnant women to abstain from smoking</li>\r\n<li>Unnecessary exposure to cold and high humidity should be avoided</li>\r\n<li>Pets such as cats and dogs should be kept away from asthma patients</li>\r\n<li>Emotional stress and worry should be reduced</li>\r\n<li>Annual immunization with influenza vaccine may be of help</li>\r\n<li>Physical exercises may be of help, however, care must be taken to avoid further problems.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Anemia</h3>\r\n<p>The term anemia is a condition that occurs when blood is deficient of healthy red blood cells or hemoglobin. Sometimes, when the number of red blood cells in a specified quantity of blood is below normal, anemia is suspected. Normal blood contains 40-45 percent red blood cells and 55-60 percent plasma. A man&rsquo;s blood normally contains more hemoglobin than that of a woman. 100ml of blood of a normal man contains 14-16 grams of hemoglobin while that of a woman contains 12-14 grams. Any adult having less than 12 grams of hemoglobin per 100ml of blood may be considered anemic.</p>\r\n<p>Hemoglobin is a very important part of red blood cells. It can be divided into two &ndash; &lsquo;hemo&rsquo; and &lsquo;globin&rsquo;. &lsquo;Hemo&rsquo; has to do with iron molecules which have a strong affinity for oxygen which it sends to other parts of the body for the liberation of energy. &lsquo;Globin&rsquo; has to do with protein for body building and replacement of worn out tissues.</p>\r\n<h4>Causes of Anemia</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Faulty red blood cell production. This is as a result of lack of some minerals and vitamins necessary for the production of healthy red blood cells</li>\r\n<li>Loss of blood. In this case, red blood cells can be lost by gastro-intestinal conditions such as cancer, ulcer, and so on as well as internal bleeding (hemorrhage). Blood could also be lost by women during child birth or during their menstrual period.</li>\r\n<li>Destruction of red blood cell. This is prevalent when red blood cells assume a sickle shape due to sickle cell disease. The body destroys these sickle shaped red cells because they are unable to pass through small blood vessels (arteries). Because of the destruction of these red cells, the body is denied red cells resulting in anemia.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>Symptoms</h4>\r\n<p>Some of the common symptoms and signs of anemia include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The person is easily fatigued or fagged out</li>\r\n<li>He or she experiences shortness of breath when involved in any physical activity</li>\r\n<li>The heart beat is usually irregular</li>\r\n<li>Headache</li>\r\n<li>In extreme cases, deformed fingernails are seen.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>Prevention and Control</h4>\r\n<p>Anemia could be prevented if the under listed instructions are followed judiciously.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Avoid prolonged sickness. See the doctor as soon as you take ill.</li>\r\n<li>Eat food rich in vitamins and minerals to ensure the production of healthy red blood cells</li>\r\n<li>Pregnant mothers should visit good hospitals to avoid much loss of blood during child birth</li>\r\n<li>Women whose menstrual flow is in excess should seek medical help.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Kwashiorkor</h3>\r\n<p>Kwashiorkor is a protein deficiency disease prevalent among the poor and low income group. Children are more vulnerable to this disease than adults because children&rsquo;s source of protein after weaning is not available due to poverty and sometimes ignorance.</p>\r\n<h4>Causes of Kwashiorkor</h4>\r\n<p>The major cause of Kwashiorkor is when protein nutrient is deficient in the body, that is, when the child is not fed with protein rich foods such as milk, meat, soya beans, fish, vegetables, egg, and beans.</p>\r\n<h4>Symptoms</h4>\r\n<p>Kwashiorkor presents the following symptoms:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The child looks puffy and bloated due to retention of water in the body</li>\r\n<li>He is usually weak and unable to participate in physical activities with other children</li>\r\n<li>The luxuriant black hairs become discolored, that is it changes from black to brown</li>\r\n<li>When it is fully developed, the child develops protruding abdomen and thin legs</li>\r\n<li>Growth is stunted because body building nutrient, protein is not available</li>\r\n<li>There may be frequent watery stooling</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>Prevention</h4>\r\n<p>Since kwashiorkor is a dietary deficient disease, it can be prevented by eating protein rich diet. Such protein rich foods include milk, meat, soya beans and fish. A technical way of preventing the disease is by advising poor parents to have limited number of children so that they can take care of them conveniently.</p>', 'JSS 2', 'Basic Science', '2021-10-13 13:05:46', '2021-10-13 13:05:46'),

(99, 22, 'Chapter 22', 'Operating System', '<h2>TOPIC 22: OPERATING SYSTEM</h2>\r\n<p>An operating system (OS) is software that communicates with the hardware and allows other programs to run. It is comprised of system software, or the fundamental files your computer needs to boot up and function. Every desktop computer, tablet and smartphone includes an operating system that provides basic functionality for the device. Common desktop operating systems include Windows, Mac OS X and Linux. While each OS is different, they all provide a graphical user interface (GUI) that includes a desktop and the ability to manage files and folders. They also allow you to install and run programs written for the operating system. While Windows and Linux can be installed on standard PC hardware, Mac OS X can only run on Macintosh computers. Therefore, the hardware you choose affects what operating systems you can run.</p>\r\n<p>Mobile devices such as tablets and smartphones also include operating systems that provide a GUI that can run applications. Common mobile operating systems include Android, iOS and Windows Phone. These operating systems are developed specifically for portable devices and therefore are designed around touchscreen input.</p>\r\n<p>Since the operating system serves as a computer&rsquo;s fundamental user interface, it significantly affects how you interact with the device. Therefore, many users prefer to use a specific operating system. For example, one user may prefer to use a computer with Mac OS X instead of a windows-based PC. Another user may prefer an android-based smartphone instead of an iphone which runs the iOS.</p>\r\n<p>When software developers create applications, they must write and compile them for a specific operating system. This is because each OS communicates with the hardware differently and has a specific application program interface (API) that the programmer must use. While many popular programs are cross platform, meaning they have been developed for multiple operating systems, some are only available for a single operating system. Therefore, when choosing a computer, it is important to make sure the operating system supports the programs you want to run.</p>\r\n<h3>Examples of Operating Systems</h3>\r\n<p>There are many different operating systems. Each does the same thing: They control all input, processing and output.</p>\r\n<p><strong>DOS</strong> &ndash; Disk Operating System was one of the first operating systems for the personal computer. When you turn the computer on, all you will see is the command prompt which displayed: c:\\&gt;. You have to type all commands at the command prompt or command line. This is not user friendly.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Windows</strong> &ndash; The windows operating system, a product of Microsoft, is a GUI operating system. This type of user friendly operating system is said to have WIMP features which include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Windows</li>\r\n<li>Icons</li>\r\n<li>Menus</li>\r\n<li>Pointing device (mouse)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Mac OS</strong> &ndash; Macintosh, a product of apple, has its own operating system with a GUI and WIMP features.</p>\r\n<p><strong>UNIX</strong> &ndash; Linux (the PC version of UNIX) was originally created with a command line interface but recently have added GUI enhancements.</p>\r\n<p>User friendly is a relative term. The current GUI provided by windows and Mac operating systems are more friendly than the previous DOS systems but still require us to conform to their specifications.</p>\r\n<h3>What is an Operating System?</h3>\r\n<p>The operating system is the core software component of your computer. It performs many functions and is in very basic terms, an interface between your computer and the outside world. A computer consists of several component parts including the monitor, keyboard, mouse and other parts. The operating system provides an interface to these parts using what is referred to as drivers. This is why sometimes when you install a new printer or other piece of hardware, your computer will ask you to install software called a driver.</p>\r\n<h3>What Does a Driver Do?</h3>\r\n<p>A driver is a specially written program which understands the operation of the device it interfaces to, such as a printer, video card, sound card or CD ROM drive. It translates commands from the operating system or user into commands understood by the component computer part it interfaces with. It also translates responses from the component computer part back to responses that can be understood by the operating system, application program or user.</p>\r\n<h3>Other Operating System Functions</h3>\r\n<p>The operating system provides several other functions such as:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>System tools (programs) used to monitor computer performance, debug problems, or maintain parts of the system</li>\r\n<li>A set of libraries or functions which programs may use to perform specific tasks especially relating to interfacing with computer system components.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The operating system makes these interfacing functions along with its other functions operate smoothly and these functions are mostly transparent to the user.</p>\r\n<h3>Operating System Concerns</h3>\r\n<p>As mentioned previously, an operating system is a computer program. Operating systems are written by human programmers who make mistakes. Therefore, there can be errors in the code even though there may be testing before the product is released. Some companies have better software quality control and testing than others so you may notice varying levels of quality from operating system to operating system. Errors in operating systems cause three main types of problems.</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>System crashes and instabilities</strong>: These can happen due to software bug typically in the operating system, although computer programs being run on the operating system can make the system more unstable or even crash the system by themselves. This varies depending on the type of operating system. A system crash is the act of a system freezing and becoming unresponsive which would cause the user to need to reboot.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Security flaws</strong>: Some software errors leave a door open for the system to be broken into by unauthorized intruders. As these flaws are discovered, unauthorized intruders may try to use these to gain illegal access to your system. Patching these flaws often will help keep your computer system secure.</li>\r\n<li>Sometimes errors in the operating system will cause the computer not to work correctly with some peripheral devices such as printers.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h3>Operating System Types</h3>\r\n<p>There are many types of operating systems. The most common is the Microsoft suite of operating systems. They include:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>Windows 10, Windows 8.1, Windows 8, Windows 7 and Windows Vista</strong></li>\r\n<li><strong>Windows XP Professional Edition</strong> &ndash; A version used by many businesses on workstations. It has the ability to become a member of a corporate domain.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Windows XP Home Edition</strong> &ndash; A lower cost version of Windows XP which is for home use only and should not be used at a business.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Windows 2000</strong> &ndash; A better version of the Windows NT operating system which works well both at home and as a workstation at a business. It includes technologies which allow hardware to be automatically detected and other enhancements over Windows NT.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Windows ME</strong> &ndash; An upgraded version from Windows 98 but it has been historically plagued with programming errors which may be frustrating for home users.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Windows 98</strong> &ndash; This was produced in two main versions. The first Windows 98 version was plagued with programming errors but the windows 98 second edition which came out later was much better with many errors resolved.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Windows NT</strong> &ndash; A version of windows made specifically for businesses offering better control over workstation capabilities to help network administrators.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Windows 95</strong> &ndash; The first version of windows after the older windows 3.x versions offering a better library functions for programs.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>There are other worthwhile types of operating systems not made by Microsoft. The greatest problem with these operating systems lies in the fact that not as many application programs are written for them. However, you can get the type of application programs you are looking for.</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>UNIX</strong> &ndash; A system that has been around for many years and it is very stable. It is primarily used to be a server rather than a workstation and should not be used by anyone who does not understand the system. It can be difficult to learn. UNIX must normally run on a computer made by the same company that produces the software.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Linux</strong> &ndash; Linux is similar to UNIX in operation but it is free. It also should not be used by anyone who does not understand the system and can be difficult to learn.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Apple Macintosh</strong> &ndash; Most recent versions are based on UNIX but it has a good graphical interface so it is both stable (does not crash) and easy to learn. One drawback to this system is that it can only be run on Apple hardware.</li>\r\n</ol>', 'JSS 2', 'Basic Science', '2021-10-13 13:05:46', '2021-10-13 13:05:46'),

A bit has a single binary value, either 0 or 1. In most computer systems, there are eight bits in a byte.

A bit is usually abbreviated as &ldquo;b&rdquo;.</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>Nibble</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>Half a byte (four bits) is called a nibble.</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>Byte</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>In most computer systems, a byte is a unit of data that is eight binary digits long. A byte is the unit most computers use to represent a character such as a letter, number or typographic symbol. A byte can be a string of bits that need to be used in some larger unit of application purposes ( for example, the stream of bits that constitute a visual image for a program that displays images or the string of bits that constitutes the machine code of a computer program). In some computer systems, four bytes constitute a word, a unit that a computer processor can be designed to handle efficiently as it reads and processes each instruction. Some computer processors can handle two-byte or single-byte instructions. A byte is usually abbreviated as &ldquo;B&rdquo;. Computer storage is usually measured in byte multiples. For example, an 820 MB hard drive holds a nominal 820 million bytes or megabytes of data. Byte multiples are based on powers of two and commonly represented by a rounded off decimal number. For example one megabyte &ndash; one million bytes is actually 1,048,576 decimal bytes.</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>Octet</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>In some systems, the term octet is used for an eight-bit unit instead of byte.

(101, 24, 'Chapter 24', 'Computer Problem Solving Skills', '<h2>TOPIC 24: COMPUTER PROBLEM SOLVING SKILLS</h2>\r\n<h3>Computer Program</h3>\r\n<p>A computer program is a sequence of instructions written to perform a specified task with a computer. A computer requires programs to function, typically executing the program&rsquo;s instructions on a central processor. The program has an executable form that the computer can use directly to execute the instructions. The same program in its human readable source code form from which executable programs are derived (e.g. compiled), enables a programmer to study and develop its algorithms. A collection of computer programs and related data is referred to as the software.</p>\r\n<p>Computer source code is typically written by computer programmers. Source code is written in a programming language that usually follows one of two main paradigms: imperative or declarative programming. Source code may be converted into an executable file by a compiler and later executed by a central processing unit. Alternatively, computer programs may be executed with the aid of an interpreter or may be embedded directly into hardware.</p>\r\n<p>Computer programs may be ranked along functional lines: system software and application software. Two or more computer programs may run simultaneously on the computer from the perspective of the user. This process is known as multitasking.</p>\r\n<h3>Computer Programming Language</h3>\r\n<p>A computer programming language is any of various languages for expressing a set of detailed instructions for a digital computer. Such instructions can be executed directly when they are in the machine language. Although there are over 2,000 computer languages, relatively few are widely used. Machine and assembly languages are low level, requiring a programmer to manage explicitly all of a computer&rsquo;s idiosyncratic features of data storage and operation. In contrast, high-level languages shield a programmer from worrying about such considerations and provide a notation that is more easily written and read by programmers.</p>\r\n<h3>Language Types and Examples</h3>\r\n<h4>Machine and Assembly Language</h4>\r\n<p>A machine language consists of the numeric codes for the operations that a particular computer can execute directly. The codes are strings of 0s and 1s or binary digits which are frequently converted both from and to hexadecimal (base 16) for human viewing and modification. Machine language instructions typically use some bits to represent operations such as addition and some to represent operands or perhaps the location of the next instruction. Machine language is difficult to read and write since it does not resemble conventional mathematical notation or human language and its codes vary from computer to computer.</p>\r\n<p>Assembly language is one level above machine language. It uses short mnemonic codes for instructions and allows the programmer to introduce names for blocks of memory that hold data. Assembly language is designed to be easily translated into machine language. Although blocks of data may be referred by name instead of by their machine address, assembly language does not provide more sophisticated means of organizing complex information. Like machine language, assembly language requires detailed knowledge of internal computer architecture. It is useful when such details are important, as in programming a computer to interact with input/output devices (printers, scanners, storage devices and so forth).</p>\r\n<h4>Algorithmic Languages</h4>\r\n<p>Algorithmic languages are designed to express mathematical or symbolic computations. They can express algebraic operations in notation similar to mathematics and allow the use of subprograms that package commonly used operations for reuse. They were the first high-level languages.</p>\r\n<p><strong>FORTRAN</strong></p>\r\n<p>The first important algorithmic language was FORTRAN (Formula Translation), designed in 1957 by an IBM team led by John Backus. It was intended for scientific computation with real numbers and collections with real numbers and collections of them organized as one or multidimensional arrays. Its control structures included conditional IF statements, repetitive loops (so-called DO loops), and a GOTO statement that allowed consequential execution of program code. FORTRAN made it convenient to have subprograms for common mathematical operations and built libraries of them. FORTRAN was also designed to translate into efficient machine language. It was immediately successful and continues to evolve.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ALGOL</strong></p>\r\n<p>ALGOL (Algorithmic Language) was designed by a committee of American and European computer scientists during 1958-60 for publishing algorithms as well as for doing computations. ALGOL had recursive subprograms &ndash; procedures that could be invoke by themselves to solve a problem by reducing it to a smaller problem of the same kind. ALGOL introduced block structure, in which a program is composed of blocks that might contain both data and instructions and have the same structure as an entire program. Block structure became a powerful tool for building large programs out of small components. ALGOL was widely used in Europe and for many years it remained the language in which computer algorithms were published. Many important languages, such as Pascal and Ada are its descendants.</p>\r\n<p><strong>LISP</strong></p>\r\n<p>LISP (List Processing) was developed about 1960 by John McCarthy at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and was founded on the mathematical theory of recursive functions (in which a function appears in its own definition). A LISP program is a function applied to data rather than being a sequence of procedural steps as in FORTRAN and ALGOL. LISP uses a very simple notation in which operations and their operands are given in a parenthesized list. LISP also uses list structure to represent data and because programs and data use the same structure, it is easy for a LISP program to operate on other programs as data. LISP became a common language for artificial intelligence (AI) programming partly owing to the confluence of LISP and AI work at MIT and partly because AI programs capable of learning could be written in LISP as self-modifying programs.</p>\r\n<p><strong>C</strong></p>\r\n<p>The C programming language was developed in 1972 by Dennis Ritchie and Brian Kernighan at the AT&amp;T Corporation for programming computer operating systems. Its capacity to structure data and programs through the composition of smaller units is comparable to that of ALGOL. It uses a compact notation and provides the programmer with the ability to operate with.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>', 'JSS 2', 'Basic Science', '2021-10-13 13:05:46', '2021-10-13 13:05:46'),

The best way to avoid this situation is to keep drinks and all liquid substances away from the computer system.</p>\r\n<h3>Using Dust Cover</h3>\r\n<p>Computer dust covers will not only serve as a PC filter but also as a protector of your hard work and investment. Computer dust cover will protect your computer from dust and harmful particles that can cause overheating and result in greater problems later on.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>Protection From Power Problems</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Sags</strong>: Sags are short-term decreases in voltage levels. This is the most common power problem. Sags are usually caused by the start-up power demands of many electrical devices. Electric companies use sags to cope with extraordinary power demands. A sag can starve a computer of the power it needs to function and cause frozen keyboards and unexpected system crashes which results in both lost or corrupted data. Sags also reduce the efficiency and life span of electrical equipment, particularly motors.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Blackout</strong>: This is the total loss of utility power. Blackouts are caused by excessive demand on the power grid, lightning storms, ice on power lines, earthquakes and other catastrophes. This causes the current work in the RAM and cache is lost. The hard drive file allocation table (FAT) may also be lost which results in total loss of data stored on drive.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Spikes and Surges: </strong>Also referred to as an impulse, spikes are instantaneous, dramatic increases in voltage. They are typically caused by lightning strikes and can cause catastrophic damage to hardware.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>Protecting Your Computers and Data</h3>\r\n<p>Our computers need to be protected from theft, fraud, harmful content and provided with steady &ldquo;clean&rdquo; power that does not sag, spike or blackout. We must therefore identify and decide what level of protection our computer systems require.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Connect all electronic equipment to uninterruptible power supply to protect them from electric surges and spikes.</li>\r\n<li>Unplug your system when not in use for long.</li>\r\n<li>Avoid connecting devices that may have virus to your computer system.</li>\r\n<li>Protect your passwords and personal data from unauthorized personnel using firewall and other security software</li>\r\n<li>Avoid visiting untrusted and intrusive sites that may steal your personal data.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<h3>Ways of Misusing the Internet</h3>\r\n<p>The internet has been a blessing to humanity. It has made life easier and helped technology improve. We rely on the internet for a lot of relevant and reliable information that we use for school work, research and so on. But the internet also has disadvantages too. No invention of man can be perfect. Though the advantages of using the internet are numerous, we cannot ignore the disadvantages.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Electronic Spam &ndash; This is electronic junk that is usually unwanted and sent in large quantities to numerous recipients. A major negative effect of electronic spam is that it uses up a lot of bandwidth and it may include malware.</li>\r\n<li>The internet also contains negative, disturbing and harmful content accessible to everyone using it. Most of the time, these can appear as intrusive ads that divert your attention from the work you intended to use the internet for.</li>\r\n<li>A lot of other evil vices take place on the internet such as hacking, identity theft, false information and pornography.</li>\r\n</ul>', 'JSS 2', 'Basic Science', '2021-10-13 13:05:46', '2021-10-13 13:05:46'),
(103, 26, 'Chapter 26', 'Safety Measures When Using the Computer', '<h2>TOPIC 26: SAFETY MEASURES WHEN USING THE COMPUTER</h2>\r\n<p>Computers have become part of our daily life and there are different safety measures to be followed while working on them apart from proper posture and placement of the device. This not only helps to avoid electric shocks but also helps to keep your stored data and system safe.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Liquids and electronics do not mix and a spill on your keyboard or other electronic equipment can be hazardous. Not only can such a spill cause sparking and shock, but sills can severely damage delicate electronics. To avoid spills, keep all drinks away from electronic if possible and always use sturdy cups with lids to minimize any accidents. Try to avoid the habit of drinking water, tea, coffee, etc. while working on a computer desk. Wipe your hands before you operate any computer or electronic device. Do not place your computer close to places where there is moisture.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>The Sitting Posture</strong></p>\r\n<p>Before starting work, make sure to check your position with the computer. Frequent posture changes is effective in reducing stress on the body and redistributing pressure caused by long lengths of working in a stationary or static position.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Keep the monitor in front of you so that your neck is aligned straight. Do not turn your neck to the side to work</li>\r\n<li>The screen should be set so you don&rsquo;t bend your neck up or down to view the screen</li>\r\n<li>The monitor should be 16-30 inches or an arm&rsquo;s length away</li>\r\n<li>Place frequent used items within arm&rsquo;s reach to avoid over stretching</li>\r\n<li>Place the feet flat on the floor or on a footrest</li>\r\n<li>Adjust your chair to provide good back support</li>\r\n<li>Set the back tilt to a slightly reclined position of 100-110Ëš</li>\r\n<li>The height of the keyboard and pointing device should be low enough so your arms are relaxed at your sides</li>\r\n<li>The keyboard should be wide enough to include the mouse or pointing device</li>\r\n<li>The wrist or palm rest should be as wide as the usable portions of the keyboard and should match the shape and height of the keyboard. The palm rest supports the heel of the hand and decreased hand contact with the table edges</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Upright Sitting Posture</strong>: The user&rsquo;s torso and neck are approximately vertical and in-line. The thighs are approximately horizontal and the lower legs are vertical.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Standing Posture</strong>: The user&rsquo;s legs, torso, neck and head are approximately in-line and vertical. The user may also elevate one foot on a rest while in this posture.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Inclined Sitting Posture</strong>: The user&rsquo;s thighs are inclined with the buttocks higher than the knee. The angle between the thigh and torso is greater than 90Ëš. The torso is vertical or slightly reclined and the legs are vertical</p>\r\n<p><strong>Reclined Sitting Posture</strong>: The user&rsquo;s torso and neck are straight and reclined between 100 and 120Ëš from the thighs.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Posture Variations</strong>: There is no single &ldquo;correct&rdquo; posture. There are many variations of neutral posture and depending on what tasks you have to perform and the furniture in your workstation; you may find one of these alternatives to be more comfortable to you. These variations are useful when changing postures throughout the day.</p>\r\n<p><strong>90 Degree Posture</strong>: Sit upright with your elbows, hips and knees bent at right angles and your feet flat on the floor or on a footrest. This position is biochemically correct but it can stress your back muscles over time.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Reclining Posture</strong>: Lean back into the chair&rsquo;s backrest and put your feet out in front of you to open up the angle at your hips and knees. This helps relax your back muscles and promotes blood circulation. Leaning back too far can result in an awkward neck posture when trying to keep your head upright.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Forward Tilt Posture</strong>: Raise the height of your chair&rsquo;s seat a few inches and tilt the front of it downward about 8Ëš. This will open up your hip angle and allow you to support some of your weight using your legs rather than having it all rest on your hips and the backs of your thighs. You may not find this posture comfortable if you have knee or foot problems or if you feel like you are sliding off the seat. A contoured chair/seat can help to hold you in place.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Standing Posture</strong>: Standing provides the biggest change in posture and is a good alternative to prolonged sitting which can aggravate low back injuries. It can be fatiguing however, so have a counter height chair available at standing workstations. Also prop one foot up on a low foot rest occasionally to help shift your weight.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Monitor Positioning</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Angle: </strong>Place the monitor directly in front of you and facing you not angled to the left or right. This helps to eliminate too much neck twisting. Also, whatever the user i9s working with, encourage him/her to use the screen scroll so that whatever is being viewed is at the center of the monitor not at the top or bottom of the screen.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Centering: </strong>Center the monitor on the user so that the body and/or neck are not twisted when looking at the screen.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Height: </strong>Ensure that the monitor at a confortable height that does not make the user tilt their head up or down to see what is on the screen. If the monitor is too low the user will have to adjust his/her neck forwards, if it is too high, they&rsquo;ll tilt their head backwards and end up with neck/shoulder pain.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Viewing Distance:</strong> The monitor should be at a comfortable horizontal distance for viewing which is around an arm&rsquo;s length. At this distance, you should be able to see the viewing area of the monitor without moving your head.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Screen Quality</strong>: Use a good quality computer screen. Make sure that the text characters on your screen looks sharp and that they are a comfortable size. You can change the resolution to find a comfortable and clear character size.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Eye Health</strong>: There are natural changes in vision that occur in most people during their early 40s. It is a good idea to periodically have your eyes checked by a qualified professional. If any screen adjustments feel uncomfortable, change them until the arrangement feels more comfortable or seek further professional help.</p>', 'JSS 2', 'Basic Science', '2021-10-13 13:05:47', '2021-10-13 13:05:47'),
(104, 27, 'Chapter 27', 'Basic Knowledge of Information Technology', '<h2>TOPIC 27: BASIC KNOWLEDGE OF INFORMATION TECHNOGY</h2>\r\n<p>ICT (Information and Communications Technology) is an umbrella term that includes any communication device or application encompassing radio, television, cellular phones, computer and network hardware and software, satellite systems and so on, as well as the various services and applications associated with them such as videoconferencing and distance learning. According to the European Commission, the importance of ICT lies more in its ability to create greater access to information and communication in underserved populations. Many countries around the world have established organizations for the promotion of ICT. Examples of Information and Communication Technology are the Computer, Telephone, Cellular Network, Satellite Communication, Television, Internet, etc.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Benefits of Information Technology</strong></p>\r\n<p>In general, IT has brought about significant improvements in business operations and in the entire human life as whole.</p>\r\n<p>Talking about globalization, I.T. has not only brought the world closer together, but it has allowed the world&rsquo;s economy to become a single independent system. This means that we can not only share information quickly and efficiently, but we can also bring down barriers of linguistic and geographical boundaries. The world has developed into a global village due to the help of information technology allowing countries who are not only separated by distance but also by language to share ideas and information with each other.</p>\r\n<p>In communication, I.T. has helped to make communication cheaper, quicker and more efficient. We can now communicate with anyone around the world by simply texting or emailing them for an almost instantaneous response. The internet has also opened up face to face direct communication from different parts of the world thanks to the help of video conferencing.</p>\r\n<p>In terms of functionality and flexibility, internet I.T. can help improve infrastructure performance thus increasing functionality and the range of options that can br pursued. Externally, it can help create an efficient, flexible online/offline platform for doing business with customers, suppliers and partners.</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>Communication:</strong>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Rapid communications can help increase productivity, allow for better business decision making and ease a company&rsquo;s expansion into new territories or countries. Email servers, routers, internal company billboards and chat services can serve as the backbone of a company&rsquo;s communications. These electronically based communication systems are used to disseminate routine and critical business information in a quick and efficient manner. I.T. equipment can be used to send business status reports to executives to update employees on critical business projects and to connect with business partners and customers.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Efficiency:</strong>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Streamlined work flow systems, shared storage and collaborative work spaces can increase efficiency in a business and allow employees to process a greater level of work in a shorter period of time. Information technology systems can be used to automate routine tasks, to make data analysis easier and to store data in a manner that can easily be retrieved for future use. Technology can also be used to answer customer questions through email or telephone routing system that connects a customer to an available customer service agent.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Competitive Advantage:</strong>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Adoption of information technology resources allows companies to maintain a competitive advantage over their rivals. Companies using a first-movers strategy can use information technology to create new products, distance their products from the existing market or enhance their customer services. Companies that follow a low-cost product strategy can look to information technology solutions to reduce their costs through increased productivity and reduced need for employee overhead. Businesses can also build-in information technology to their products that makes it difficult for customers to switch platforms or products.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Economic Efficiencies:</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>Companies can harness information technology resources to lower their costs. Using I.T. infrastructure, redundant tasks can be centralized at one location. For example, a large company could centralize their payroll function at one location to lower employee costs. Economic efficiencies can also be realized by migrating high cost functions into an online environment. Companies can offer email support for customers that may have a lower cost than a live customer support call. Cost savings could also be found through outsourcing opportunities, remote work options and lower-cost communication options.</p>\r\n<p><strong>The Disadvantage of Information Technology</strong></p>\r\n<p>Advances in information technology changed the way business is conducted. Correspondence that once took weeks to get from one organization to another is now delivered instantly with the push of a button. Advances in telecommunication allow associates from all point of the globe to confer a virtual environment, minimizing the need for business travel. Although the benefits of integrating information technology in business are many, there are also disadvantages to its use.</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>Implementation Expenses:</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>Every business must consider startup costs when implementing any type of information technology system. In addition to the cost of hardware and software, some technology vendors require businesses to purchase user licenses for each employee that will be operating the basic system. Businesses must examine the cost of training employees in unfamiliar technology. Although basic information technology systems may be user friendly, advanced programs still require formal instruction by an expert consultant</p>\r\n<ol start=\"2\">\r\n<li><strong>Job Elimination</strong>:</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>Implementing information technology to business operations can save a great deal of time during the completion of daily tasks. Paperwork is processed immediately and financial transactions are automatically calculated. As technology improves, tasks that were formerly performed by human employees are now carried out by computer systems. For example, Automated telephone answering systems have replaced live receptionists in many organizations. This leads to the elimination of jobs and in some cases, alienation of clients. Unemployed specialists and one-loyal employees may have difficulty securing future employment.</p>\r\n<ol start=\"3\">\r\n<li><strong>Security Breaches:</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>The ability to store information in an electronic database facilitates quicker, more efficient communication. In the past, an individual would sift through stacks of paper records to retrieve data. With properly implemented technology, information can be recovered at the touch of a button. Although information technology systems allow businesses to be conducted at a faster pace, they are not without their flaws. Information technology systems are vulnerable to security breaches particularly when they are accessible via the internet. If appropriate measures are not in place, unauthorized individuals may access confidential data. Information may be altered, permanently destroyed or used for unsavory purposes.</p>\r\n<p><strong>I.T. Gadgets</strong></p>\r\n<p>The GSM (Global system for Mobile communication) is a mobile telephony system that is widely used in Europe and other parts of the world. GSM uses a variation of time division multiple access (TDMA) and is the most widely used of the three digital telephony technologies. GSM digitizes and compresses data then sends it down a channel with two other streams of user data each in its own time slot. It operates at either the 900MHZ or 1800MHZ frequency band. Mobile services based on GSM technology were first launched in Finland in1991. Today, more than 690 mobile networks provide GSM services across 213 countries and GSM represents 82.4% of all global GSM connections. According to GSM world, there are now more than 2 billion GSM mobile phone users worldwide and references China as the largest single GSM market with more than 370 million users followed by Russia with 145 million.</p>\r\n<p>A fax (short for facsimile and sometimes called telecopying) is the telephonic transmission of scanned-in-printed material (text or images), usually to a telephone number associated with a printer or other output device. The original document is scanned with a fax machine which treats the contents as a single fixed graphic image converting it into a bitmap. In this digital form, the information is transmitted as electrical signals through the telephone system. The receiving fax machine reconverts the coded image and prints a paper copy of the document.</p>\r\n<p>A telephone is a device that converts sound and electrical waves into audible relays and is used for communication. The telephone consists of two essential parts, a microphone and a speaker. This allows the user to speak into the device and also hear transmissions from the other user. The invention of the first telephones required an operator to connect calls are now connected automatically. Telephones formally utilized analog signals to transmit sounds but most calls are now placed over digital networks. Telephones are made in a variety of forms including a subset of the device called a cell phone or mobile phone also called phone</p>', 'JSS 2', 'Basic Science', '2021-10-13 13:05:47', '2021-10-13 13:05:47'),
(105, 28, 'Chapter 28', 'Internet', '<p><strong>TOPIC 28: INTERNET</strong></p>\r\n<p>Internet is defined as a means of connecting a computer to any other computer anywhere in the world via dedicated routers and servers. When two computers are connected over the internet, they can send and receive all kinds of information such as text, graphics, voice, video and computer programs. No one owns the internet although several organizations in the world collaborate in its functioning and development. The high speed fiber optic cables through which the bulk of the internet data travels are owned by smartphone companies in their respective countries.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;The internet grew out of the Advanced Research projects Agency&rsquo;s Wide Area Network (ARPANET) established by the US Department of Defense in the 1960s for collaboration in military research among business and government laboratories. Later universities and other US institutions connected to it. This resulted in ARPANET growing beyond everyone&rsquo;s expectations and acquiring the name &lsquo;Internet.&rsquo;</p>\r\n<p>The development of hypertext based technology called World Wide Web provided means of displaying text, graphics and animations. A website address also known as a URL (uniform resource locator) is an internet or intranet name that points to a location where a file, directory or website page is hosted. Website addresses can represent the homepage of a web site, a script, image, photo, movie or other file made available on a server for viewing, processing or download. They can also be embedded into the code of web pages in the form of hyperlinks to direct the user to other locations on the internet.</p>\r\n<p>A web browser is a software application for retrieving, presenting and traversing information resources on the World Wide Web. An information resource is identified by a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI/URL) and may be a web page, image, video or other piece of content. Hyperlinks present in resources enable users easily to navigate their browsers to related resources. Although browsers are primarily intended to use the World Wide Web, they can also be used to access information provided by web servers in private networks or files in file systems.</p>\r\n<p>The primary purpose of a web browser is to bring information resources to the user allowing them to view the information and then access other information. Available web browsers range in features from minimal, text-based user interfaces with bare-bones support for HTML to rich user interfaces supporting a wide variety of file formats and protocols. Bowsers which include additional components are referred to as internet suites rather than merely web browsers. All major web browsers allow the user to open multiple information resources at the same time, either in different browser windows or in different tabs of the same window.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Abuse of Internet: Fraud and Financial Crimes</strong></p>\r\n<p>Computer fraud is any dishonest misrepresentation of fact intended to let another to do or refrain from doing something which causes loss. In this context, the fraud will result in obtaining benefit by:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Altering in an unauthorized way. This requires little technical expertise and is not an uncommon form of theft by entering false data using unauthorized processes</li>\r\n<li>Altering, suppressing, destroying or stealing output usually to conceal unauthorized transactions which is difficult to detect</li>\r\n<li>Altering or deleting stored data</li>\r\n<li>Altering or misusing existing system tools o software packages or altering or writing code for fraudulent purposes.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Other forms of fraud may be facilitated using computer systems including bank fraud, identity theft, extortion and theft of classified information. A variety of internet scams target customers directly.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Viruses</strong></p>\r\n<p>A computer virus is a program that is hidden within the code of another program.

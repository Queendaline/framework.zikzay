<h3>STATE OF MATTER AND THEIR PROPERTIES</h3>
<h4>Solid</h4>
<p>Properties: - High density because there is little or no space between the particle of the solid. It has definite shape and volume because of strong attractive forces between the particles of solid.</p>
<h4>Liquid</h4>
<p>Properties: - High density because particles are quite close. It has a fixed volume but not a fixed shape because the attractive force is not strong enough to give it a fixed shape, rather it assumes the shape of its container.</p>
<h4>Gas</h4>
<p>Properties: - Low density because of the space between the particles and can be compressed easily. Gas has neither definite volume nor definite shape because of the weak intermolecular forces between the molecules. The gas particle can vibrate</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Difference between Solid and Gas</h4>
<ol>
<li>For Solid :- The particles are held together rigidly by strong force of attraction while that of gas has negligible forces between the particles.</li>
<li>For Solid :- Particles vibrate in fixed position while that of gas particles are in constant motion.</li>
<li>For Solid :- They cannot be compressed easily while that of gases are highly compressible.</li>
<li>For Solid :- They have definite shape while gases have no definite shape.</li>
<li>For Solid :- They do not expand appreciable on heating, while gases rapidly expand on heating.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Difference between Solid and Gas</h4>
<ol>
<li>Solid have definite shape while the liquid assumes the shape of the container or have no shape.</li>
<li>Solid particles are closely packed while that of liquid particles are loosely bonded.</li>
<li>Modules of solid are in a lower state of disorder while that of gases their molecules are in a higher state of disorder.</li>
<li>For the solid there are existence of strong intermolecular cohesive forces while for liquid there are weak (van der waal) force of attraction.</li>
<li>For solid, they have shorter molecular distance, while for liquid, longer molecular distance.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Change of State</h4>
<p>The change of state using ice-block as example. The various processes that are involved, include sublimation, melting, freezing, evaporation and condensation.</p>
<h5>Kinetic Theory of Gases and Phenomena that Support the Kinetic Theory.</h5>
<ul>
<li>The force of attraction between the molecules is negligible.</li>
<li>The actual or total volume occupied by the gas is negligible compared with the volume of the container.</li>
<li>The gas molecules move randomly in a straight line, colliding with one another and also with the wall of the container.</li>
<li>The average kinetic energy of the molecules is directly proportional to the absolute temperature.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Phenomenon that Support the Kinetic Theory of Matter<strong>.</strong></h5>
<p>This include diffusion, osmosis, dialysis, Brownian movement and change of state.</p>
<ol>
<li>Diffusion is the movement of a fluid (gas or liquid) from a region of higher concentration to a region of lower concentration.</li>
<li>Osmosis is the passage of solvent molecules from area of lower concentration to that of higher concentration through a semi-permeable membrane.</li>
<li>Dialysis is the separation of crystalloids from colloidal particle using semi-permeable membrane. Crystalloid is anything that is soluble in water.</li>
<li>Brownian Movement &ndash; The random motion of particles suspended in a liquid or gas is called Brownian motion. The particles of matter are in constant motion. This constant and zigzag movement of particle can be observed with;</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>A piece of Sulphur suspended in water is viewed under microscope or pollen grain suspended in a drop of water is observed under a microscope.</li>

<h3>CARBON</h3>
The chemistry of carbon compounds is known as organic chemistry. The study of its compounds such as oxides, carbonates etc. Sulphur trioxocarbonate(vi) and hydrogen trioxocarbonate(iv) is included in inorganic chemistry. Carbon is a non metal belonging to group 4 and period 2 in the periodic table with electronic configuration of 1s<sup>2</sup>, 2s<sup>2</sup>, 2p<sup>2</sup> (2,4). It has the oxidation state of +2 and +4.
<h5>SOURCES/OCCURRENCE</h5>
Carbon occurs in various forms.
<ol>
<li>Naturally as diamond and graphite.</li>
<li>In impure form as Coal</li>
<li>In combined form as petroleum (crude oil), wood and natural gases.</li>
<li>As mineral deposit of metallic trioxocarbonate(iv) CaCO (lime stone), magnesium trioxocarbonate(iv) MgCO<sub>3</sub>.</li>
<li>In the air and water as carbon(iv)oxides (CO<sub>2</sub>). Carbon is also present in almost all the food we eat.</li>
</ol>
<h5>ALLOTROPES OF CARBON</h5>
Carbon exist in crystalline form (eg diamond and graphite) and non-crystalline form or amorphous form. Hence it exists in three different allotropic form;
<ol>
<li>Diamond</li>
<li>Graphite</li>
<li>Amorphous</li>
</ol>
Allotropy is the existence of an element in various form in the same physical state. These different forms of an element in the same physical state are referred to as allotropes.
<h3>DIAMOND</h3>
Diamond is the purest form of natural occurring carbon. Its found in South America, Brazil, India, Liberia, Guyana, Venezuela.
STRUCTURE: - Diamond is octahedral in shape. In diamond, each carbon atom is joined to four other carbon atoms by strong covalent bond to form a rigid network structure. Each carbon atoms around it, at the center of the tetrahedral, this network structure is repeated and forms a giant molecule.
<h4>PROPERTIES OF DIAMOND</h4>
<ol>
<li>Diamond is the hardest substance known as a transparent solid.</li>
<li>It has a high melting point.</li>
<li>It is very dense and resistant to high temperature and chemical attack.</li>
<li>It is a non-conductor of electricity since there is no valence electron in the diamond crystal.</li>
</ol>
<h4>USES OF DIAMOND</h4>
<ol>
<li>Since diamond is very dense and hard to use, it is used as follows;</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Industrially in drills for mining</li>
<li>As abrasive to sharpening hard tools.</li>
<li>For cutting glass, metals and rocks.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li>It is used as pivot support in precision instrument.</li>
<li>Its high refractive index and dispersive power makes it valuable as gemstones in Jewelry Industry.</li>
</ol>
<h3>GRAPHITE</h3>
Graphite occurs naturally as plumbago, an opaque black solid. It is mined mainly in Austria, China, West Germany, Korea, Mexico etc.
STRUCTURE: - Graphite is made up of flat layers of carbon atoms. The layers of carbon atoms lie on top of one another and are held together by weak van dar wall forces within each layer. Each carbon atoms forms strong covalent bonds with three other carbon atoms. This forms rings of six carbon atom (hexagonal crystal) that join together to form two-dimensional flat layer known as layer LATTICE.

<h4>PROPERTIES OF GRAPHITE</h4>
<ol>
<li>It is soft black slippery and flakes easily.</li>
<li>It has a density of 2-3g/cm<sup>3</sup> (less dense than diamond)</li>
<li>It has a high melting point.</li>
<li>It is relatively inert to chemical attack.</li>
<li>It is a good conductor of electricity because of the presence of mobile electrons in its crystals.</li>
</ol>
<h4>USES OF GRAPHITE</h4>
<ol>
<li>It is a dry lubricant in engines, since it is slippery and allows one layer to slide over another easily.</li>
<li>It is used in bicycle chains and for bearing of some motor vehicles.</li>
<li>It is used as electrodes in electrolytes.</li>
<li>It is used as black pigment in paint.</li>
<li>It can be used in the manufacture of lead pencil when mixed with clay.</li>
</ol>



<h3>AMORPHOUS CARBON</h3>
Amorphous carbon includes; - coal, charcoal, lampblack, end carbon black (soot) with exception of coke which is mineral from natural deposits, the other forms of amorphous carbon. The carbon consists of minute crystals of graphite bound together by impurities.
COAL: - Is a black organic rock formed by the vegetation of carbon ferrous era which was burned underground millions of years ago under bacterial action, great pressure and temperature in the absence of air. This process is known as carbonization. It is a very impure carbon.
<h4>TYPES OF COAL</h4>
There are four types of Coal: -
<ol>
<li>PEAT: - This is the first stage of Coal formation. It is soft with high moisture content. It is about 60% carbon by mass.</li>
<li>LIGNITE COAL: - It is brown coal with a high moisture content. It is the softest and has the lowest carbon content.</li>
<li>BITUMINOUS: - Its dense and has a higher carbon content than lignite. It is referred to as soft coal, about 88% carbon by mass.</li>
<li>ANTHRACITE COAL (HARD COAL): - Is the hardest with high carbon content (92-98%)</li>
</ol>
<strong></strong>
<h4>DESTRUCTIVE DISTILLATION OF COAL/ INDUSTRIAL DISTILLATION</h4>
When coal is heated to a very high temperature in the absence of air, it decomposes to give four main products; Coal Coke Ammoniacal liquour Coal tar Coal gas
<ol>
<li>COKE: - It is the non-volatile residue left after the destructive distillation of coal. It is about 98% carbon by mass. It is used in the manufacture of gaseous fuel and as a reducing agent in extraction of metal.</li>
<li>AMMONIACAL LIQUOUR: - is a solution of ammonia water. It is used in making nitrogenous fertilizer (eg (NH<sub>4</sub>)SO&shy;&shy;<sub>4</sub>) and in making pharmaceutical products.</li>
<li>COAL TAR: - Is a thick black liquid. It is a mixture of many organic substances like benzene, phenol, tolvens, naphthalene, which can be separated by fractional distillation. It can be used in synthesis of useful chemicals such as disinfectants, Insecticides, explosives, drugs, perfumes and dyes and can be used as solvent for rubber and paint.</li>
<li>COAL GAS: - Is a volatile component consisting of a mixture of gases such as hydrogen, methane, carbon(ii)oxide, ethene. It is used for industrial heating. It is a cleaner gas than coal and other solid fuels.</li>
</ol>
<h3>CHARCOAL</h3>
Charcoal can be made by heating wood, nut shells, bones sugar and even blood.
<h4>TYPES OF CHARCOAL</h4>
<ol>
<li>WOOD CHARCOAL: - It is prepared by heating wood with limited supply of air. It contains impurities such as Sulphur. It is used in gas-mash absorbing for poisoning gases and it can also be used for purification of noble gases.</li>
<li>SUGAR CHARCOAL: - This is obtained by heating table sugar in a limited supply of air or by action of concentrated tetraoxosulphate(vi) acid. It is the purest form of amorphous carbon.</li>
</ol>
 Conc. H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>
C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>  6C + 6H<sub>2</sub>O
<ol>
<li>ANIMAL CHARCOAL: - Is prepared by heating bones and animal refuse in a limited supply of air. It contains a high percentage of calcium, tetraoxosulphate(v) as impurity. It has the properties of absorbing coloring matter, ore, powerful decoloring agent in decolorizing petroleum jelly. It is also used in removing the brown color from crude sugar.</li>
</ol>
CARBON BLACK, LAMP BLACK (SOOT)
Carbon black or soot is finely divided carbon particles produced by burning carbonaceous material in a limited supply of air. Lamp black is obtained from vegetable or lamp oils, while carbon black is obtained from coal gas, natural gas or fuel oils. Coal black is used in making rubber tyres, black shoe polish, printers ink, typewriting ribbons and carbon papers.
COMBUSTION OF CARBON ALLOTROPES
When carbon allotropes burn in air or excess oxygen, it produces carbon(iv) oxide, although the temperature required differs.
 C<sub>(s)</sub> + O<sub>2(g)</sub> CO<sub>2(g)</sub>
When supply of air is limited, combustion may not be complete. Thus, carbon(ii) oxide is formed.
 2C<sub>(s)</sub> + O<sub>2(g)</sub> 2CO<sub>(g)</sub>
The combustion of carbon in highly exothermic, thus carbon allotropes are widely used as fuel.
CHARCOAL FIRE: -
Charcoal is extensively used for making fires.
At level <strong>A</strong>, the charcoal is in direct contact with the incoming air, it burns to give carbon(vi) oxide only.
At level B, the air supply is limited, the ascending CO comes in contact with more charcoal and it is reduced to carbon(ii)oxide. CO<sub>2(g)</sub> + C<sub>(s)</sub> 2CO<sub>(g)</sub>
At level <strong>C</strong>CO<sub>(g)</sub> comes in contact with a lot of air and is oxidized to carbon(iv) oxide. 2CO<sub>(g)</sub> + O<sub>2(g) </sub>2CO<sub>2(g)</sub>
COMBINATION REACTION
Carbon combines directly with certain elements such as Sulphur, hydrogen, calcium and aluminum at very high temperature.
 C<sub>(s)</sub> + 2S<sub>(s)</sub> CS<sub>2(l)</sub>
 Carbon(iv) sulphide.
 C<sub>(s)</sub> + 2H&shy;<sub>2(g)</sub> CH<sub>4(g)</sub>
 Methane
<sub> </sub>2C<sub>(s)</sub> + Ca<sub>(s) </sub>CaC<sub>2(s)</sub>
  Calcium carbide
 C<sub>(s) </sub>+ 4Al<sub>(s)</sub> Al<sub>4</sub>C<sub>3(s)</sub>
  Aluminum Carbide
<h3>GASIFICATION OF COKE</h3>
This is the conversion of coke (carbonaceous) material to important gaseous fuels water gas and producer gas.
PRODUCER GAS: - Is a mixture of carbon(iv)oxide and Nitrogen. It is prepared by passing air over red-hot coke in a furnace. The oxygen oxidizes the coke to carbon(ii)oxide CO with the liberation of large amount of heat while the Nitrogen is unchanged. Hence, the reactor is exothermic.
 2C<sub>(s)</sub> + O<sub>2(g)</sub> N<sub>2(g)</sub> 2CO<sub>(g)</sub> + N<sub>2(g)</sub>
The mixture of one third of carbon(ii) oxide and two third of nitrogen forms the producer gas.
WATER GAS: - This is a mixture of equal volume of carbon(ii) oxide and hydrogen. It is prepared by passing steam on, while hot coke is in the furnace at 1000<sup>o</sup>C.
 C<sub>(s)</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>(g)</sub> CO<sub>(g)</sub> + H<sub>2(g)</sub>
The reaction is endothermic.
Water gas is more efficient fuel than producer gas because both CO and H<sub>2</sub> burn in it and are combustible.
<h4>USES OF PRODUCER GAS AND WATER GAS</h4>
Producer:
<ol>
<li>Used in heating furnace.</li>
<li>It is a source of nitrogen for the manufacture of ammonia by Haber process.</li>

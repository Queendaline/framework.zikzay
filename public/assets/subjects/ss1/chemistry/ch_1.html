<h2>CHAPTER 1</h2>
<h3>INTRODUCTION TO CHEMISTRY</h3>
<p>Chemistry is one of the three main branches of pure science, the other two being biology and physics. Chemistry deals with the composition, properties and uses of matter. It probes into the principles governing the changes that matter undergoes, both physical and chemical changes.</p>
<h3>WHY WE STUDY CHEMISTRY</h3>
<p>Everything in this world is made up of matter. We study chemistry to acquire knowledge about matter. We perform experiments and learn to observe, record and make intelligent inferences. Studying chemistry gives us training in the scientific method. This acquired knowledge and training will help us to become scientists in the field of chemistry. Such scientists known as <strong><em>chemists</em></strong>.</p>
<h3>CHEMISTRY IN OUR LIFE</h3>
<p>We see changes around us all the time. Familiar activities and happenings like lighting a match, cooking, burning firewood, making palm wine, rusting nails, rotting leaves are examples of chemical reactions.</p>
<p>All the things we use everyday such as soap and detergent for cleaning, hair cream and perfumes for grooming, oil and margarine, plastics for a wide variety of uses, are made by chemical processes.</p>
<h3>SCIENTIFIC METHOD</h3>
<p>Scientist are always very alert and inquisitive. They use their sense to observe what is happening around them. From the given set of observations, they see a certain pattern. This often leads to a problem which they try to solve. They put forward a reasonable explanation or hypothesis and carry out appropriate experiments to test it. Then they carefully record their observations and the results of their experiments.</p>
<p>If the experiments support the hypothesis, they carry out further investigations. They discuss the hypothesis and the results with other scientists in the field so that the hypothesis can be further tested. When a hypothesis has been tested and found to be correct within the limits of available evidence, it becomes a <em>theory</em>. A scientific law or principle is established only after the theory has been extensively tested and proven to be true without any exception.</p>

<h3>USES OF CHEMISTRY</h3>
<p>Chemistry has contributed greatly towards providing our basic needs and improving the quality of our life at large.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Food:</strong> Fertilizers and insecticides have greatly enhance food productivity, Chemical process have been designed for preservation and storage of food for long periods, so that it can be exported to distant countries and is available to more people. Many foods are now enriched by addition of essential nutrients which helps to fight malnutrition.</li>
<li><strong>Clothing:</strong> Man-made textile fibres, produced as a result of intensive chemical research, have made a wide range of clothing material.</li>
<li><strong>Military:</strong> Chemistry contributes to the discovery and description of the theoretical bases for the behavior of chemical substances such as explosives used by the military. Ammunition technology applies the knowledge of chemistry to attain specific goals.</li>
<li><strong>Space Science</strong>: In our efforts to gain more knowledge of the other planets and outer space around us, special rockets called &ldquo;space rocket&rdquo; are sent into space which was made possible by science and technology.</li>
<li><strong>Housing:</strong> Buildings need materials like cement, concrete, steel, bricks and tiles which are produced by chemical industries. The mechanical properties of these materials are a result of chemical research.</li>
<li><strong>Medicine:</strong> The health life that many of us enjoy is due to the variety of medicines that are available as a result of chemical research and technology.</li>
<li><strong>Transportation:</strong> The rapid development from carts pulled by animals to the latest aircraft was made possible by chemists producing suitable fuels and structural materials like alloys which are light, strong and heat-resistant.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Adverse Effects of Chemistry</h3>
<p>Chemical processes and products have also affected and is still affecting our life adversely in many ways.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Corrosion of iron</strong>: Corrosion of iron can also be called <strong>rusting</strong> and requires the presence of water and oxygen. Rusting can also be regarded as the slow deterioration of iron to iron (iii) oxide. This iron oxide is permeable to both air and water and cannot protect the iron from further corrosion.</li>
</ul>
<p>This rusting can be prevented by four methods</p>
<ul>
<li>Application of protective coating</li>
<li>Application of sacrificial metal</li>
<li>Alloying</li>
<li>Catholic protection.</li>
<li><strong>Pollution: </strong>One of the main disadvantages of chemical industries is the pollution of our environment by</li>
<li>Chemical wastes from factories and oil refineries; and</li>
<li>Radioactive wastes from nuclear plants.</li>
<li><strong>Drug abuse: </strong>Drugs like heroin, cocaine and morphine are additive. Although many of these drugs are not used in medical treatment, unscrupulous produce and sell them at huge amount. Drug addition is a major problem in our society, especially among the younger people as a result of these drugs made available at their disposal.</li>
</ul>
<h3>CAREER IN CHEMISTRY</h3>
<p>Many job opportunities are available for students with knowledge of chemistry. The public and private sectors of the economy which offer such opportunities are given below.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Teaching service:</strong> Chemistry teachers and lecturers in secondary schools, colleges of education and universities. Laboratory assistants in schools and universities.</li>
<li><strong>Health service: </strong>Pharmacists, biochemists, chemists, nutritionists, dietitians, doctors, nurses, medical assistants, laboratory assistants and dispensers.</li>
<li><strong>Food processing:</strong> Food technologists and research chemists.</li>
<li><strong>Petroleum and petrochemical industries:</strong> Application chemists, research chemists, chemical engineers and laboratory assistants.</li>
<li><strong>Manufacturing industry:</strong> Research chemists and chemical engineers in the wide variety of manufacturing industries such as iron and steel works, and cement factories.</li>
<li><strong>Extraction industry:</strong> Chemists, mining engineers and geologists.</li>
<li><strong>Agriculture:</strong> Agricultural scientists, chemists, biochemists and physiologists engaged in research to improve the quality and yield of crops and livestock, and to advice farmers.</li>
<li><strong>Forestry:</strong> Scientists engaged in research to preserve and improve forestry products.</li>
</ul>

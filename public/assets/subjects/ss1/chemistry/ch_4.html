<h2>CHAPTER 4</h2>
<h3>ATOMIC STRUCTURE</h3>
<p>Atom is the smallest particle of matter. It consists of three particles, called proton, electron and neutron. Protons and neutrons are placed at the center of the atom and electrons are placed around the center. Picture given below shows, structure of atom and locations of proton neutron and electron in atom.%%%%019%%%%</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Center of the atom, including protons and neutrons, is called also nucleus and circles around nucleus are called orbits.</p>
<h4>Atomic Number:</h4>
<p>Atomic number shows the number of protons in each atom. It is specific for each atom and shown with letter "Z". In neutral atom number of protons is equal to number of electrons. Thus;</p>
<p>Z = p = e</p>
<p>Atomic number is written as;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $_{atomic~number~}X$</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h4>Mass Number:</h4>
<p>Mass of the neutron is approximately equal to the mass of proton. We neglect mass of electron since it is too small. Thus, mass of atom is equal to the sum of mass of protons and neutrons. We show mass number with letter "M". Mass number is not specific for each atom. Different atoms can have same mass number.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>M = n + p</p>
<p>We show M on the atom as;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $_{Z}^{M}X$</p>
<p>Electron Configuration with Examples</p>
<h4>Isotopy</h4>
<p>Isotopy is a phenomenon whereby atoms of an element exhibit different mass numbers but have the same atomic number. This is due to difference in the number of neutrons present in these atoms. Such atoms are known as isotopes.</p>

<h3>Electronic Structure of the Atom</h3>
<h4>The four quantum numbers</h4>
<p>Studies show that energy of an electron may be characterized by four quantum numbers. These four quantum numbers define an electron within an atom, they are,</p>
<ol>
<li>The principal quantum number, n, has integral values 1,2,3,4, etc. The energy levels or shells are determined by the principal quantum numbers.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that the maximum number of electrons in a shell given by 2n<sup>2</sup> and the total number of orbitals is given n<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>The subsidiary or azimuthal quantum number <em>I</em>, has integral values ranging from 0 to (n-1). The electrons with subsidiary quantum numbers 0, 1, 2 and 3 are usually referred to as the s, p, d, and f electrons respectively. Thus, this quantum number shows how many energy sublevels there are in each electron shell.</li>
<li>The magnetic quantum number, m, which has integral values ranging from -1 through 0 to 1, shows the number of orbitals in each energy sublevel, e.g the p subshell has three p orbitals.</li>
<li>The spin quantum number, s has values -1/2 and +1/2</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that an orbital can only hold two electrons which spin on their axes in opposite directions. Their spins are donated by the spin quantum numbers.</p>
<h4>Electron Configuration</h4>
<p>Electrons are not placed at fixed positions in atoms, but we can predict approximate positions of them. These positions are called energy levels or shells of atoms.</p>
<ul>
<li>Lowest energy level is 1 and it is denoted with integer n=1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6... or letters starting from K, L, N to Q. An atom can have maximum 7 energy levels and electrons can change their levels according to their energies.</li>
<li>Each energy level has different number of electrons. For example, we can find number of electrons in four energy level with following formula; 2n<sup>2</sup>.</li>
</ul>
<p>1st energy level has;</p>
<p>2n<sup>2</sup>=2.1<sup>2</sup>=2 electrons</p>
<p>2nd energy level has;</p>
<p>2n<sup>2</sup>=2.2<sup>2</sup>=8 electrons</p>
<p>3rd energy level has;</p>
<p>2n<sup>2</sup>=2.3<sup>2</sup>= 18 electrons</p>
<ul>
<li>Electrons are located energy levels starting from the first energy levels. If one of the energy level is full, then electrons are placed following energy level.</li>
</ul>
<p>Electron configuration of atom shows, shells, sub shells and number of electrons in sub shells. We examine electron configuration with following examples.</p>
<p>Example: Helium 2</p>
<p>1s<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>Where;</p>
<p>1 is the principal quantum number or energy level (shell)</p>
<p>s is the sub-level or sub shell (Capacity of s sub shell is 2 electron)</p>
<p>2 shows the number of electrons in the s sub shell</p>
<p>Example: Chlorine 17</p>
<p>1s<sup>2</sup>2s<sup>2</sup>2p<sup>6</sup>3s<sup>2</sup>3p<sup>5</sup></p>
<p>Coefficients 1, 2, 2, 3, and 3 are energy levels of Cl. As you can see "p" sub shell can have maximum 6 electrons.</p>
<p>Superscripts 2, 2, 6, 2 and 5 are electrons in the sub shells "s" and "p".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Example: Bromine 35</p>
<p>1s<sup>2</sup>2s<sup>2</sup>2p<sup>6</sup>3s<sup>2</sup>3p<sup>6</sup>4s<sup>2</sup>3d<sup>10</sup>4p<sup>5</sup></p>
<p>As you can see "d" sub shell can have maximum 10 electrons.</p>
<p>Example: Tantalum 73</p>
<p>1s<sup>2</sup>2s<sup>2</sup>2p<sup>6</sup>3s<sup>2</sup>3p<sup>6</sup>4s<sup>2</sup>3d<sup>10</sup>4p<sup>6</sup>5s<sup>2</sup>4d<sup>10</sup>5p<sup>6</sup>6s<sup>2</sup>4f<sup>14</sup>5d<sup>3</sup></p>
<p>As you can see "f" sub shell can have maximum 14 electrons.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h4>Orbitals and Placing Electrons to Orbitals with Examples</h4>
<p>When external energy is given to atoms, some of them change their energy levels. We call this state of atom as; exited state. For example, following electron configurations belong to <sub>8</sub>O, one of them is ground state and other one is exited state.</p>
<p>1s<sup>2</sup>2s<sup>2</sup>2p<sup>4</sup> : "ground state"</p>
<p>1s<sup>2</sup>2s<sup>2</sup>2p<sup>3</sup>3s<sup>1</sup> : "exited state"</p>
<p>Elements are in ground states most of the time. When we solve examples you should always take them in ground state.</p>
<p><strong>Showing Electrons in Orbitals (sub shells)</strong></p>
<p>We show orbitals with following shape;%%%%025%%%%</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Capacity of each orbital is two electrons. We can also show electrons in orbitals as follows ;%%%%026%%%%</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are some rules for placing electrons in orbitals. For example, electrons must be placed orbitals having same energy level one by one. If orbitals are not filled with electrons, you can not pass another energy level. Look at the following figure that shows number of orbitals in each sub level s, p, d, f; %%%%027%%%%</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Examine following examples to understand placing electrons in orbitals.</p>
<ol>
<li><sub>5</sub>B: 1s<sup>2</sup>2s<sup>2</sup>2p<sup>1</sup>%%%%028%%%%</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><sub> 6</sub>C: 1s<sup>2</sup>2s<sup>2</sup>2p<sup>2</sup> %%%%029%%%%</li>
<li><sub>7</sub>N: 1s<sup>2</sup>2s<sup>2</sup>2p<sup>3</sup> %%%%030%%%%</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><sub>8</sub>O: 1s<sup>2</sup>2s<sup>2</sup>2p<sup>4</sup> %%%%031%%%%</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Spherical Symmetry</strong></p>
<p>Spherical symmetry makes atom more stable. Half filled or filled orbitals show us spherical symmetry.</p>
<p>s : 1e- or 2e-</p>
<p>p : 3e- or 6e-</p>
<p>d : 5e- or 10e-</p>
<p>f: 7e- or 14e-</p>
<p>Orbitals s, p, d, f have given electrons above, has spherical symmetry.</p>
<p><sub>7</sub>N=1s<sup>2</sup>2s<sup>2</sup>2p<sup>3</sup> p orbital has 3 electrons, thus N has spherical symmetry.</p>
<p><sub>8</sub>O=1s<sup>2</sup>2s<sup>2</sup>2p<sup>4</sup> p orbital has 4 electrons, thus O has NO spherical symmetry.</p>
<h4>Electron Configurations of Ions</h4>
<p>If&nbsp; electron is bound to neutral atom, atom becomes negatively charged ion. We calculate total number of electrons and make electron configuration.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Write electron configuration of&nbsp; <sub>9</sub>F<sup>-</sup>.</p>
<p>F ion has 9+1=10 electrons.</p>
<p><sub>9</sub>F<sup>-</sup>=1s<sup>2</sup>2s<sup>2</sup>2p<sup>6</sup></p>
<p>If electron gives electron it becomes positively charged ion.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Write electron configuration of&nbsp; <sub>14</sub>Si<sup>+</sup>. <sub>14</sub>Si<sup>+2</sup>, <sub>14</sub>Si<sup>+3 </sup>.</p>
<p><sub>14</sub>Si<sup>+</sup> has 14-1=13 electrons</p>
<p>1s<sub>2</sub>2s<sub>2</sub>2p<sup>6</sup>3s<sup>2</sup>3p<sup>1</sup></p>
<p><sub>14</sub>Si<sup>+2 </sup>has 14-2=12 electrons</p>
<p>1s<sup>2</sup>2s<sup>2</sup>2p<sup>6</sup>3s<sup>2</sup></p>
<p><sub>14</sub>Si<sup>+3 </sup>has 14-3=11 electrons</p>
<p>1s<sup>2</sup>2s<sup>2</sup>2p<sup>6</sup>3s<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Rare gases (stable electronic configuration)</h3>
<p>The rare gases exhibit great chemical stability. All of them except helium have 8 electrons in their outermost shells. This electronic arrangement is known as the octet. Helium, with 2 electrons in its outermost shell, has a duplet and octet arrangements in their outermost shells.</p>
<h3>CHEMICAL COMBINATION</h3>
<p>The atom of noble gases e.g. Helium, He, Neon Ne are very stable; because their outermost shells are completely filled with electrons. The tendency of the other elements is to attain this stable structure possessed by the noble gases. This is achieved during <strong><em>chemical combination</em>. </strong>Thus, <strong>chemical bonding </strong>is the coming together of atoms of the same or different elements, in order to form a stable structure.</p>

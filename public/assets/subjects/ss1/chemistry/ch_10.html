<h2>CHAPTER 10</h2>
<h3>WATER</h3>
<p>Water is one of the most common substances. It is a substance which can exist in the three state of matter, as solid, (ice), liquid, (water) and gaseous water or steam (vapor). It is a universal solvent in that it can dissolve a wide range of substance.</p>
<h4>SOURCES OF WATER</h4>
<p>Water occurs rarely in its pure form in nature. It can be obtained as natural water and as treated water.</p>
<h5>NATURAL SOURCES OF WATER</h5>
<p>Natural water includes rain water, spring water, lake water, river, well water, sea water etc.</p>
<ol>
<li>RAIN WATER: - It is the purest form of natural water because it is formed as a result of condensation of water vapor in the atmosphere. It is a natural form of distilled water.</li>
<li>SPRING WATER: - It is a good source of drinking water. It contains a considerable amount of mineral salt but very little suspended impurities like dust and bacteria.</li>
<li>WELL WATER: - We have deep well and surface well. Well water contains a lot of clay and other mineral salts. Water from deep well (like borehole) are less polluted than that from surface well.</li>
<li>SEA WATER: - The sea is the chief source of water. It is hard and contains a lot of dissolved salts, dissolved air, bacteria, organic remains etc</li>
<li>RIVER WATER; - It contains a lot of dissolved air, mineral salt, bacterial, organic remains. Rivers are used extensively for sewage disposal.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>TREATED SOURCE OF WATER</h4>
<p>It includes (i) distilled water (ii) pipe borne water and (iii) chlorinated water</p>
<p>Treated water is usually prepared for special purpose; Pipe borne water for lawn water supply. Chlorinated water for use in swimming pool.</p>
<p>Distilled water is chemical pure water. It is prepared by condensing stem or passing water through anion exchange resin column.</p>
<h5>USES OF DISTILLED WATER</h5>
<ol>
<li>It is used in the lab for preparing reagents and analytical work.</li>

<p>There are two types of water</p>
<ol>
<li>HARD WATER:- Contains high concentration of dissolved minerals particulates especially calcium and magnesium. Making it difficult to lather with soap</li>
<li>SOFT WATER:- is the water that contains little or no dissolved mineral. Making it easier to lather with soap. E.g distilled water.</li>
</ol>
<h4>HARDNESS OF WATER</h4>
<p>A hard water is the water which does not latter (or foam) easily or readily with soap. It forms insoluble salts(scum) with soap due to the presence of the dissolved salt like CaSO<sub>4</sub>, MgSO<sub>4</sub>, Ca (HCO<sub>3</sub>)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dissolved salt + soap insoluble salt(scum) + soluble salt. E.g. CaSO<sub>4</sub> + CisH<sub>3</sub>iCOONa &nbsp;(CisH<sub>3i</sub>COO)<sub>2</sub>Ca + Na<sub>2</sub>SO (salt causing hardness) sodium</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TYPES OF HARDNESS OF WATER</h4>
<ul>
<li>Temporary hardness of water.</li>
<li>Permanent hardness of water.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>TEMPORARY:- Is the type of hardness of water which can be removed by boiling.</li>
</ol>
<p>CAUSES:- Caused by the presence of dissolved hydrogen trioxocarbonate (iv) usually calcium hydrogen trioxocarbonate (iv) Ca(HCO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> in water.</p>
<p>REMOVAL: (i) By boiling, boiling decomposes the soluble Ca (HCO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> to insoluble CaCO<sub>3</sub> thus precipitating the calcium ion out of the solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ca (CHCO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> &nbsp;CaCO<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>(l)</sub> + CO<sub>2(g)</sub></p>

</ol>
<h4>WATER POLLUTION</h4>
<p>Water pollution is the introduction of unwanted materials into water bodies. It occurs when harmful substances enter water bodies (like rivers, streams etc)</p>
<h5>CAUSES WATER POLLUTANTS</h5>
<p>The main cause of water pollution is the indiscriminate dumping of solids and liquid wastes into water bodies. Some water pollutants include;</p>
<ol>
<li>Industrial Wastes (Eg Acids, Detergents, Organic Solvents, alkali mercury compounds, In sea trades) etc.</li>
<li>Agricultural wastes eg Fertilizers</li>
<li>Untreated sewage (eg feces, waste water from home and industries).</li>
<li>Refuse/liters eg. Paper, plastics, cans, food, etc.</li>
<li>Crude oil spills</li>
<li>Thermal pollution, water used for cooling. In same industries refinery, brewery is pumped back into the river, thereby causing the death of some aquatic organism like fishes.</li>
</ol>
<h5>CONTROL OF WATER POLLUTION</h5>
<ol>
<li>Sewage should be processed, treated and converted to useful fertilizers in sewage plants.</li>
<li>Refuse should be burned or burnt in an incubator with in-built devices to prevent air pollution.</li>
<li>Chemical waste should be converted to harmless biodegradable substance before being dumped into the sea.</li>
<li>Safety measures must be implemented to prevent crude oil spills.</li>
<li>Strict laws must be passed to control water pollution by water individuals and companies.</li>
<li>Educating people should also serve as anti-pollution measure to make people aware of the dangers of water pollution.</li>
</ol>
<h4>USES OF WATER</h4>
<p>Water is a universal solvent; in that it dissolves a wide variety of substances (inorganic and organic) to some extent to form aqueous solution. Many of its uses depend in its ability to dissolve many different types of substances.</p>
<ol>
<li>FOR LIFE PURPOSES: - Water is needed for life purposes like photosynthesis. Each cell in a living organism needs water to function properly. Aquatic organisms depend on dissolved oxygen in water for respiration.</li>
<li>FOR DOMESTIC USES: - Water is needed for drinking, cooking, washing and cleaning in the home.</li>
<li>FOR INDUSTRIAL USES: - water is used in food and chemical industries as raw material in the production of goods, paper, metals and chemicals like drug. It is used for cooking and cleaning processes in industries.</li>
<li>FRO RECREATIONAL PURPOSES: - Lake sides, beaches, and water parks are some places for people to carry out leisure activities such as sailing, swimming, etc. it is needed for building and maintaining swimming pools.</li>
<li>IN AGRICULTURAL: - Water is used for irrigation of farmlands and for fish ponds etc.</li>
</ol>

<h3>NATURE OF MATTER: SEPARATION TECHNIQUES</h3>
<h4>Matters</h4>
<p>We call everything having mass and volume matter, such as air, table, water. Matters having shape are called object. There are two types of changes in the structure of matter, chemical change and physical change.</p>
<h4>Physical and Chemical Changes</h4>
<p>Matter undergoes changes. These changes may be temporary and easily reversible or they may be permanent and very difficult to reverse. The former is known as a <em>physical</em> change and the latter as a <em>chemical</em> change.</p>
<h5>Physical changes</h5>
<p>A physical change is one which is easily reversed and in which no new substances are formed. Physical state of matters is changed. In physical changes, matters can return its old&nbsp;structure, no new matter is produced, and chemical structure of the matters does not change. For example, melting of ice, breaking glass.</p>
<h5>Chemical changes</h5>
<p>A chemical change is one which is not easily reversed and in which new substance are formed. During chemical changes, new matter is produced, chemical structure of matter is changed, matter cannot turn its old structure, energy spent on this change is larger than the energy spent on physical changes. For example, burning paper, rusting of an iron, photosynthesis.</p>
<h5>Properties of matter</h5>
<p>We can examine properties of matters under two titles; physical properties and chemical properties.</p>
<p><em>Physical </em>properties are properties associated with physical changes. Common physical properties of a substance include its boiling point, melting point, density, hardness, malleability, crystalline form, as well as properties which may be detected by the senses such as color, odor and taste.</p>
<p><em>Chemical </em>properties are those properties which are involved when matter undergoes a change to form new substances. The rusting of iron is a chemical property of iron since a new substance, iron rust, is formed.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h4>Elements, Compounds and Mixtures</h4>
<p>Matter may be classified into elements, compounds and mixtures. An element or a compound is a pure substance because it cannot be separated into more than one component by physical methods. A mixture consists of more than one element and /or compound. The compound. The components of a mixture can be separated by physical methods.</p>
<p>Most elements and compounds are not pure. They contain a small amount of other substances known as impurities. Such impure elements and compounds can also be regarded as mixtures.</p>
<h5>Elements</h5>
<p>An element is a substance which cannot be split into simpler units by an ordinary chemical process.</p>
<p>Elements constitute the building units of all other substances. Those substances which are built up of elements are known as compounds.</p>
<p>There are 109 known elements. Ninety of them occur in nature; the rest are made artificially in the laboratory. We use abbreviation or symbols to represents, e.g &ldquo;O&rdquo; for oxygen and &ldquo;H&rdquo; for hydrogen.</p>
<p>Elements can be grouped in the form of a Periodic Table. There are six types of elements: the <em>reactive metals, transition metals, lanthanides and actinides, pure metals, non-metals and noble gases. </em>More commonly, elements are grouped as <em>metals, semi-metals or metalloids</em>, and <em>non-metals</em>.</p>
<h6>Classification of Elements</h6>
<p>Elements are classified as metals, metalloids and non-metals. Metals are those elements, which ionize by electron loss example, calcium, magnesium, iron, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mg &nbsp;Mg<sup>2+</sup> + 2e</p>
<p>Non-metals are those elements which ionize by electron gain example Chlorine, Oxygen, Nitrogen, Iodine etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cl + e &nbsp;Cl<sup>-</sup></p>

<h5>Compounds</h5>
<p>A compound which contains two or more elements in specific amounts, chemically combined together. It is a new substance with entirely different properties from those of the substance from which it was formed or the its component elements. The component elements of a given compound are always present in a fixed ratio by mass. We show compounds with formulas like water H2O. Ions or molecules can produce compounds eg, Salt "NaCl", Ammonia "NH3", Iron III Oxide "Fe2O3" etc.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h5>Mixtures</h5>
<p>A mixture contains two or more different constituent which can easily be separated by physical methods. Mixed can be made up of elements or compounds, or both. All matters forming mixture keep their original properties. They are not pure matters. We can explain mixtures under two types, homogeneous mixtures and heterogeneous mixtures.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Homogeneous Mixtures:</strong> All parts of mixture show same properties in homogeneous mixtures. We can call homogeneous mixtures as solutions. Salt water, sugar water, air are examples of homogeneous mixtures.</li>
<li><strong>Heterogeneous Mixtures:</strong> Mixtures do not show same uniformity in all parts of it. In this type of mixtures, you can see different phases of matters. Water + Sand, milk, blood, soil are some common examples of heterogeneous mixtures.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Differences between Compounds and Mixtures</h5>
<ul>
<li>Ratio between matters forming compound is constant but ratio between matters forming mixture is variable.</li>
<li>Matters forming compounds lose their properties but matters forming mixtures preserve their properties.</li>
<li>Compounds can be separated with chemical methods but mixtures can be separated with physical methods.</li>
<li>Compounds are always homogenous while mixtures may be homogenous or heterogenous.</li>
<li>The properties of compounds are entirely different from those of its component elements while the properties of mixture are the sum of those of its individual constituents.</li>
</ul>
<h4>SEPARATION TECHNIQUES</h4>
<p>Various types of separation process are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Crystallization</li>
<li>Filtration</li>
<li>Decantation</li>
<li>Sublimation</li>
<li>Evaporation</li>
<li>Simple distillation</li>
<li>Fractional distillation</li>
<li>Chromatography</li>
<li>Centrifugation</li>
<li>Separating funnel</li>
<li>Magnetic separation</li>
<li>Precipitation</li>
</ul>
<p>We will discuss some of the separation techniques.</p>
<h5>Evaporation</h5>
<p>Evaporation is a technique used to separate out homogenous mixtures where there are one or more dissolved solids. This method drives off the liquid components from the solid components. The process typically involves heating the mixture until no more liquid remains, Prior to using this method, the mixture should only contain one liquid component, unless it is not important to isolate the liquid components. This is because all liquid components will evaporate over time. This method is suitable to separate a soluble solid from a liquid.</p>
<h5>Crystallization</h5>
<p>Crystallization is used to separate a dissolved heat-liable (will decompose upon heating and hence can sublime) solid (solute) from a solution. It is used to separate salts that decompose easily on heating. The salts obtained in this way are pure, and usually contain water of crystallization.</p>
<h5>Filtration</h5>
<p>Filtration is a separation method used to separate out pure substances in mixtures comprised of particles some of which are large enough in size to be captured with a porous material. Particle size can vary considerably, given the type of mixture. For instance, stream water is a mixture that contains naturally occurring biological organisms like bacteria, viruses, and protozoans. Some water filters can filter out bacteria, the length of which is on the order of 1 micron. Other mixtures, like soil, have relatively large particle sizes, which can be filtered through something like a coffee filter.</p>
<h5>Distillation</h5>
<p>Distillation is an effective method to separate mixtures comprised of two or more pure liquids. Distillation is a purification process where the components of a liquid mixture are vaporized and then condensed and isolated. In simple distillation, a mixture is heated and the most volatile component vaporizes at the lowest temperature. The vapor passes through a cooled tube (a condenser), where it condenses back into its liquid state. The condensate that is collected is called distillate.</p>
<h5>Fractional Distillation</h5>
<p>Fractional distillation is used for the separation of a mixture of two or more miscible liquids for which the difference in boiling points is less than 25K. The apparatus for fractional distillation is similar to that of simple distillation, except that a fractionating column is fitted in between the distillation flask and the condenser.</p>
<h5>Chromatography</h5>
<p>Chromatography is the separation of a mixture by passing it in solution or suspension or as a vapor (as in gas chromatography) through a medium in which the components move at different rates. Thin-layer chromatography is a special type of chromatography used for separating and identifying mixtures that are or can be colored, especially pigments.</p>
<h5>Separating Funnel</h5>
<p>A separating funnel is used for the separation of components of a mixture between two immiscible liquid phases. One phase is the aqueous phase and the other phase is an organic solvent. This separation is based on the differences in the densities of the liquids. The liquid having more density forms the lower layer and the liquid having less density forms the upper layer.</p>
<h5>Precipitation</h5>
<p>Precipitation is a process in which a solid is separated from a suspension, sol, or solution due to difference in its solubility in two of more miscible liquids. In a suspension such as sand in water the solid spontaneously precipitates (settles out) on standing. In a sol the particles are precipitated by coagulation. A solute (dissolved substance) may be precipitated from a solution by several means. A solution of salt may be concentrated by evaporation until the salt crystallizes. When a saturated solution of sugar is cooled, sugar crystals form. The addition of a solution of silver nitrate to a solution containing chloride ions results in the formation of insoluble silver chloride: AgNO3+Cl&minus;&rarr;NO3&minus;+AgCl&darr;. In each case the precipitate formed may settle out spontaneously or may be collected by filtration or centrifugation. It is often difficult to obtain a pure substance by a single precipitation, and a substance may be further purified by reprecipitation after it has been redissolved. The term precipitation is also applied to the separation of particles of a solid or liquid suspended in a gas.</p>

<h3>The Periodic Table</h3>
<p>Periodic table is the arrangement of chemical elements in order of their atomic numbers. <strong>Atomic number </strong>of an element is the number of protons in one atom of that element while, <strong>Mass number </strong>of an element is the sum of the protons and neutrons in it.</p>
<p>The basic assumption behind the modern periodic table known as <strong>Periodic Law</strong> which states that the properties of the elements are a periodic function of their atomic number.</p>
<h3>The Modern Periodic Table</h3>
<p>The modern periodic table is divided into vertical columns of elements called Groups and horizontal rows of elements called Periods. There are seven (7) periods and (8) groups. The first twenty (20) elements are:%%%%032%%%% Periodic Table</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this arrangement, a certain pattern is revealed. Elements with similar chemical properties appear at regular intervals or periods. As a result, elements in each vertical column have similar chemical properties and similar electronic configurations. Their atoms have the same number of electrons in their outermost shells.</p>
<p>Elements in the same horizontal row have chemical properties which change from metallic (on the left) to non-metallic (on the right). The number of electrons in the outermost shells of their atoms also increases progressively from left to right.</p>
<p>Thus, this trend indicates that electrons in the outermost shells of atoms are probably the ones responsive for the chemical properties of elements.</p>
<p>Owing to their electronic configuration, the rare gases are very stable. The tendency of the other elements is to attain this stable duplet or octet structure possessed by the rare gases. This is achieved during chemical combination. The attractive force between atoms when they combined chemically is called a <strong>chemical bond</strong>. There are two main types of chemical combination.</p>
<ol>
<li>Electrovalent (or ionic) combination.</li>
<li>Covalent combination, which is classed into:
<ol>
<li>Ordinary Covalent combination</li>
<li>Coordinate covalent combination.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The two main types of chemical bonds are (i) Strong bonds (ii) Weak bonds</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Strong bonds are</strong>: (a). Electrovalent (or ionic) (b). Covalent (c). Co-ordinate (or dative) (d). Metallic bond</li>
<li><strong>Electrovalent bond:</strong> In electrovalent combination, there is a transfer of electrons from one atom (usually metallic) to another (usually non-metallic). Thus, we have atoms which act as donors of electrons and those which act as acceptors of electrons. The electrons involved reside in the outermost shells of the atoms and are known as valence electrons. Electrovalent (ionic) bond is defined as the force of attraction between oppositely charged ions. <strong>Ionic compounds </strong>are crystal lattices consisting of aggregates of oppositely charged ion. Examples of such compounds are Sodium chloride, calcium oxides, ammonium chlorides etc.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Characteristics of Electrovalent bonds</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>They have high melting and boiling points</li>
<li>They are generally soluble in water</li>
<li>They are good conductors of electricity when molten or in solution</li>
<li>They do not conduct electricity when solid</li>
<li>The energy needed to separate them is relatively high.</li>
<li><strong>Covalent bonds</strong>: This is defined as the bonds formed when two atoms donate equal number of electrons and share the donated electrons attain stable octet structure. In covalent bonding, electrons are shared between atoms of the same or different elements such that each atom contributes the shared electrons so as to attain stable noble gas configurations. The molecules of simple covalent compounds are not flat structures. There are three-dimensional structures like the crystals of electrovalent compounds. The covalent bonds determine the shape of the covalent molecule.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Characteristics of Covalent bonds</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Low melting and boiling points.</li>
<li>Energy required for separation is low.</li>
<li>Do not conduct electricity in the solid or molten state, or in solution.</li>
<li>They generally have a strong, easily noticeable smell</li>
<li>They are not easily soluble in water, but are usually soluble in organic solvents.</li>
<li><strong>Co-ordinate covalent or Dative bond:</strong> this involves sharing of electrons as in the normal covalent bonding, but the shared pair is denoted by only one of the participating atoms. For instance, ammonia and water molecules possess lone pairs and so readily enter into coordinate covalent bonding.</li>
<li><strong>Metallic bond:</strong> The electrostatic force of attraction between the positive nuclei and the sea of mobile electrons is called metallic bond. Metallic bonding, therefore, is the process whereby the positively charged nuclei of metal atoms are simultaneously attracted to the sea (or cloud) of mobile electrons. Metallic bond increases with increase in valence electrons of the metal.</li>
<li><strong>Weak bonds:</strong> These are intermolecular forces of attraction that hold atoms and covalent molecules together in gases, liquids and solids.</li>
<li><strong>Van der Waals forces</strong>: Weak attractive forces exist even between discrete molecules. They were first described by J.D. van der Waals, and are known as van der Waals forces. They are weak short-ranged attractive forces formed between covalent molecules. They are the only attractive forces between the atoms of the noble gases and non-polar covalent molecules, and are responsible for the low melting and boiling point of covalent compounds. Due to increase in van der Waals forces, there is graduation in the physical properties of the Halogens: Fluorine and Chlorine are gases; bromine is a liquid; and iodine is a solid.</li>
</ol>
<p>Van der Waal force becomes stronger as the relative atomic mass increases among the non-metals.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Hydrogen bond:</strong> This is an intermolecular force which arises when hydrogen is covalently linked to highly electronegative elements like nitrogen, oxygen and fluorine.</li>
</ol>
<p>The presence of hydrogen bonds between H<sub>2</sub>O molecules is responsible for water being a liquid at room temperature and with a high boiling point; if not, it would have been a gas, like hydrogen H<sub>2</sub>O. HF is a liquid at room temperature, while HCl is a gas.</p>
<h3>SYSTEMS OF NAMING COMPOUNDS</h3>
<p>Chemical compounds are named according to International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) system. In order to understand the basic principles behind the IUPAC system, a good knowledge of the concept of oxidation number is important.</p>
<h4>Oxidation number concept</h4>
<p>An oxidation number is a positive or negative number assigned to an atom according to a set of arbitrary rules.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rule 1:</strong> The oxidation number of an element in its free (uncombined) state is zero &mdash; for example, Al(s) or Zn(s). This is also true for elements found in nature as <em>diatomic</em> (two-atom) elements such as H<sub>2, &shy;</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>, F<sub>2</sub>, Cl<sub>2</sub>, Br<sub>, </sub>or I<sub>2</sub>.</li>
<li><strong>Rule 2:</strong> The oxidation number of a <em>monatomic</em> (one-atom) ion is the same as the charge on the ion.</li>
<li><strong>Rule 3:</strong> The sum of all oxidation numbers in a neutral compound is zero. The sum of all oxidation numbers in a <a href="https://www.dummies.com/education/science/chemistry/polyatomic-ions-names-and-symbols/"><em>polyatomic</em></a> (many-atom) ion is equal to the charge on the ion. This rule often allows chemists to calculate the oxidation number of an atom that may have multiple oxidation states, if the other atoms in the ion have known oxidation numbers.</li>
<li><strong>Rule 4:</strong> The oxidation number of an alkali metal (IA family) in a compound is +1; the oxidation number of an alkaline earth metal (IIA family) in a compound is +2.</li>
<li><strong>Rule 5:</strong> The oxidation number of oxygen in a compound is usually &ndash;2. If, however, the oxygen is in a class of compounds called <em>peroxides</em> (for example, hydrogen peroxide), then the oxygen has an oxidation number of &ndash;1. If the oxygen is bonded to fluorine, the number is +1.</li>
<li><strong>Rule 6:</strong> The oxidation state of hydrogen in a compound is usually +1. If the hydrogen is part of a <em>binary metal hydride</em> (compound of hydrogen and some metal), then the oxidation state of hydrogen is &ndash;1.</li>
<li><strong>Rule 7:</strong> The oxidation number of fluorine is always &ndash;1. Chlorine, bromine, and iodine usually have an oxidation number of &ndash;1, unless they&rsquo;re in combination with an oxygen or fluorine.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><strong>Binary compounds: </strong>Binary compounds are made up of two elements. Their names end with -ide except water and ammonia. To name these binary compounds, the metal name or the more electronegative elements is mentioned first and the more electronegative elements mentioned last with the name ending with -ide.</li>
<li><strong>Another method is the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) </strong>system of nomenclature.</li>
</ol>
<p>For elements with variable oxidation state, the oxidation state is enclosed in the bracket as Roman numeral</p>

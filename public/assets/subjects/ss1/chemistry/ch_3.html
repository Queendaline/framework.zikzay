<h2><strong>CHAPTER 3&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></h2>
<h3>PARTICULATE NATURE OF MATTER</h3>
<p>Matter is anything that has weight and occupies space. Matter is made up of discrete particles, the main ones being atoms, molecules and ions.</p>
<h4>Atoms</h4>
<p>An atom is the smallest particle of an element which can take part in chemical reaction. Or</p>
<p>An atom is the smallest part of an element that can ever exist and still possess the chemical properties of that element.</p>
<h4>Molecules</h4>
<p>A molecule is the smallest particle of a substance that can normally exist alone and still retain the chemical properties of that substance, be it element or a compound.</p>
<h4>Ions</h4>
<p>An ion is any atom or group of atoms which possesses an electric charge.</p>
<h3>DALTON&rsquo;S ATOMIC THEORY</h3>
<p>John Dalton proposed the <em>Atomic Theory</em> in the year 1808, which can be summarized as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>All elements are made up of small, indivisible particles called atoms.</li>
<li>Atoms can neither be created nor destroyed.</li>
<li>Atoms of the same element are alike in every aspect, and differ from atoms of all other elements.</li>
<li>When atoms combine with other atoms, they do in a simple ratio.</li>
<li>All chemical changes results from the combination or the separation of atoms.</li>
</ol>
<p>The following laws partially supported the Atomic Theory by experimental evidence; the Law of Conservation of Mass, the Law of Definite Proportions, the Law of Multiple Proportion and so on. It could not explain electrolysis and certain other phenomena. As a result of new discoveries Dalton&rsquo;s original Atomic Theory has the undergone several modifications but the principal aspects as outlined above are still useful in the study of chemistry.</p>
<h4>MODIFICATION OF DALTON&rsquo;S ATOMIC THEORY</h4>
<ol>
<li>Matter is made up of small indivisible particles called atoms: Atoms can, however, no longer be regarded as indivisible because according to Rutherford's discovery, atom is made up of three main subatomic particles called <strong><em>protons, neutrons and electrons</em></strong>.</li>
<li>Atoms cannot be created or destroyed: This statement is still acceptable for ordinary chemical reaction but the discovery of radioactivity has shown that atoms can be created or destroyed.</li>
<li>Atoms of the same elements are alike in every aspect and differ from atoms of all other elements: The discovery of isotopes contradicts this statement. It has shown that all atom of an element are not exactly alike in all aspects.</li>
<li>Atoms of different elements can combine in simple whole number ratios to form compound: Atoms of organic compounds could be in large whole number ratios e.g C<sub>12</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>11</sub> (maltose).</li>
</ol>
<h3>Symbols of Element</h3>
<p>Berzelius suggested a simple system of representing elements with <em>symbols</em>. The first letter of the name of an element was taken as the symbols for that element: H for hydrogen, S for sulphur, O for oxygen and C for carbon. Such symbols ae written in capital letter. Where the first letter had already been adopted, the initial letter, in capital, together with a small letter from its name was used. Ca for calcium, Cl for chlorine, Zn for zinc, Ag for argon and Sr for strontium. The symbols for&nbsp; some metals were derived from their Latin names in a similar way.</p>
<h4>Formulae of Elements and Compounds</h4>
<p>A molecule of a substance is represented by the symbols of its component elements. Such a representation is known as <em>chemical formula</em>.</p>
<p>Where a number exists as a molecule, a number representing its atomicity is written as a subscript after the symbol of that element. For example, diatomic hydrogen is written as H<sub>2</sub> to show that it consists two atoms of hydrogen, triatomic molecules of ozone is written as O<sub>3</sub> to show that it contains three atoms of oxygen.</p>
<p>A molecule of a compound contains whole numbers of atoms of the component elements, its molecular formula is written as follows.</p>
<ul>
<li>The symbols of all the component elements are written close together as a group.</li>
<li>The number of atoms of each component element is written as subscript after the symbol of that element.</li>
</ul>
<p>thus the molecular formula of calcium trioxocarbonate(IV) is CaCO<sub>3</sub> since it contains one atom of carbon and three atoms of oxygen.</p>
<p>Groups of atoms, like trioxonitrate(V), -NO<sub>3</sub>, hydroxide, -OH, trioxocarbonate(IV), -CO<sub>3</sub>, and ammonium, -NH<sub>4</sub>, are known as <em>radicals</em>. Each radical is treated as a single unit in a molecular formula. When more than one unit of a radical is present in a molecule, we write the formula by enclosing the radical within parentheses, with the relevant numerical subscript after the parentheses. Thus, calcium hydroxide is written as Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> rather than CaO<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>. The subscript outside the parenthesis applies to every symbol within it so that the subscript 2 in Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> indicates two atoms, of both oxygen and hydrogen.</p>
<h5>Relative atomic mass</h5>
<p>The relative atomic mass, <em>A</em> of an element is the number of times the average mass of one atom of that element is heavier than one twelfth the mass of one atom of carbon-12.</p>
<p>From the definition, the relative atomic mass, <em>A</em><sub>r</sub> of oxygen is given by</p>
<p>$\frac{average~mass~of~1~atom~of~oxygen}{\frac{1}{12}~mass~of~1~atom~of~carbon-12}$</p>
<p>The relative atomic mass of each element has been verified accurately with the aid of the mass spectrometer.</p>
<p>Mass spectrometer is used to measure the mass of isotopes, molecules and compounds. It is the most accurate instrument for getting the mass of compounds and can also different between isotopes of the same element. A pure substance will, therefore, give value for the mass of the substance.</p>
<h5>Relative molecular mass</h5>
<p>The relative molecular mass, <em>M</em>, of an element or a compound is the number of times the average mass of one molecule of it is heavier than one twelfth of one atom of carbon-12.</p>
<p>The relative molecular mass, <em>M</em>, of an element or a compound is the sum of the relative atomic masses of all the atoms in one molecule of that substance. It is also referred to as the formula mass, which is a more general term.</p>
<h6>EXAMPLE</h6>
<p>Calculate the relative molecular mass of limestone, CaCO&shy;<sub>3</sub>, (Ca = 40, C = 12, O = 16)</p>
<p>One molecule of CaCO<sub>3 </sub>has 1 Ca, 1 C and 3 O atoms,</p>
<p>relative molecular mass of CaCO<sub>3</sub></p>
<p>= 1 x <em>A<sub>r</sub></em> of Ca + 1 x <em>A<sub>r</sub></em> of C + 3 x <em>A<sub>r</sub></em> of O</p>
<p>= (1 x 40 + 1 x 12 + 3 x 16)</p>
<p>= 100</p>
<h4>Mole</h4>
<p>One mole of a substance is the amount containing as many elementary entities as containing as many elementary entities as the number of atoms in exactly 12 grams of carbon-12. (the abbreviated form of mole is <em>mol</em>).</p>
<p>Through experimental work, it was found that 1 mole or 12 grams of carbon-12 contains 6.02 x 10<sup>23</sup> atoms. This number is known as the Avogadro Number.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Avogadro number = 6.02 x 10<sup>23</sup></p>
<p>Therefore, one mole of hydrogen atoms contains 6.02 x 10<sup>23</sup> hydrogen atoms, just as 1 dozen of eggs means 12 eggs.</p>
<p>The definition of a mole also gives the following relationship</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Number of moles a substance = $\frac{number~of~particles}{6.02~x~{{10}^{23}}}$</p>
<p>When we say one mole of substance, we must specify the type of particle. One mole of a given substance written in its formula form as one particle of the substance, regardless of whether it is a whole molecule, an atom or even an ion. Thus, C stands of one mole of carbon atoms. Similarly, Cl<sup>-</sup> stands for one mole of chloride ions same as HCl which stands for 1 mole of hydrogen chloride molecules.</p>
<p>If there are 2 moles of carbon atoms, place a 2 in front of C, ie 2C. Similarly, 6S means 6 moles of Sulphur atoms, 3CaOH means 3 moles of calcium hydroxide.</p>
<p>Hence, in the chemical reaction,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A + B C</p>
<p>We can say that one mole of A will react with exactly one mole of B in the above reaction to give one mole of C. Similarly,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; X + 2Y Z</p>
<p>We say that one mole of X will need two moles of Y to give one mole of Z.</p>
<h4>Molar mass</h4>
<p>The molar mass of any substance is the mass of one mole of that substance expressed in grams. Its unit is grams per mole (g mol<sup>â€‘</sup>). Since a mole of substance can be represented by its formula, the molar mass of a substance will be its formula mass expressed in grams. For example, the molar mass of an element will be relative atomic mass expressed in grams, and the molar mass of a compound will be its relative molecular mass expressed in grams.</p>
<h6>EXAMPLES</h6>
<ol>
<li>What is the mass of 3 moles of oxygen, gas O<sub>2</sub>? (O = 16)</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mass of 1 mole of O<sub>2</sub> = (2 x 16) g = 32g</p>
<p>Mass of 3 moles of O<sub>2</sub> = (3 x 32) g = 96g</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>How many atoms are there in 6g of carbon. C?</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(1 mole = 6 x 10<sup>23</sup>, C = 12)</p>
<p>12 g of C = 1 mole</p>
<p>6 g of C = $\frac{6}{12}$ mole = $\frac{1}{2}~$mole</p>
<p>Number of atoms in mole of C = $\frac{6~\times~{{10}^{23}}}{2}$</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; = 3 x 10<sup>23</sup></p>
<ol start="3">
<li>How many moles are there in 20 g of CaCO<sub>3</sub>? (CaCO<sub>3</sub> = 100)</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Molar mass of CaCO<sub>3</sub> = 100 g</p>
<p>100g of CaCO<sub>3</sub> = 1 mole</p>
<p>20 g of CaCO<sub>3</sub> = $\frac{20}{100}~$x 1 mole</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; = 0.2 mole</p>

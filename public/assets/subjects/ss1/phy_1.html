<h2>Topic 1</h2>
<h3>UNITS AND MEASUREMENTS</h3>
<p>Measurement is a very important aspect of Physics and other sciences. No fact in science is accepted, no law is established, unless it can be exactly measured and quantified. As Physics is based on exact measurements, every such measurement requires two things; first a number or quantity, and secondly a unit, e.g. 10 meters as the length of a room.</p>
<p>Measurements are basically a means of communication and are used by scientists and engineers for understanding unaural phenomenon, by the society for transacting business, and by the engineers for practical ends.</p>
<p>A unit or standard of measurement should be such that</p>
<ul>
<li>It must be possible to define it unambiguously.</li>
<li>It is easily reproducible.</li>
<li>It does not vary with time and place.</li>
<li>It should be possible to multiply or divide each one of the standards.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are different instruments used by physicists for measuring physical quantities and different units in which these quantities are expressed. There are also relationships between quantities and some uncertainties associated with the measuring devices.</p>
<p>At the end of this chapter the student should be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Distinguish between fundamental and derived quantities and units.</li>
<li>List and handle various measuring instruments common in a good senior secondary school physics laboratory, and used for the measurement of length, mass and time.</li>
<li>Estimate the uncertainties associated with these instruments.</li>
<li>Be familiar with the concept and use of significant figures.</li>
</ul>

<h4>1.1 Fundamental and Derived Units</h4>
<p>The three most important basic quantities in physics are length, mass and time.</p>
<p><strong>Length</strong> may be defined as the extent of space or distance extended.</p>
<p><strong>Mass</strong> is commonly defined as the quantity of matter or material substance.</p>
<p><strong>Time</strong> is defined as that in which events are distinguishable with reference to before or after.</p>
<p>Length, Mass and Time are three of the most fundamental quantities.</p>
<p><strong>Fundamental quantities</strong> are the basic quantities that are independent of others and cannot be defined in terms of other quantities or derived from them. They are the basic quantities upon which most (though not all) quantities depend.</p>
<p><strong>Fundamental units</strong> are the basic units upon which other units depend. They are the units of the fundamental quantities.</p>
<p><strong>Examples of fundamental quantities and their units are as in Table 1.1</strong></p>

<p>The units in the above table are in the SI (System International) units. The SI is the most important system today. It used to be called the MKS (metre- kilo-gramme-second) system. The SI unit is based on the metre as the unit of length, the kilo-gramme as the unit of mass, the second as the unit of tune, ampere as the unit of electric current and the kelvin as the unit of temperature. Another metric system is the c.g.s. system in which the centimetre, gram and second are the standard units of length, mass, and time.</p>
<p>SI units are the principal system of units used in scientific work today.</p>
<h3>2. Units used in Industries</h3>
<p>Units used in industry and business sometimes differ from those used in laboratory, because, in these areas, the quantities involved are very large. For example, power measured in watts in the laboratory may be measured in horsepower in industry. One horsepower (1 hp) equals 0.746 kilo Watts. In oil industries, the barrel is used as a unit of measurement; 1 barrel of oil is equal to between 120 and 159 litres. Oil prices are usually quoted in dollars per barrel. An hectare is a unit for measuring the area of land. An hectare (h) equals 10,000 square metres.</p>
<p><strong>Derived quantities and units</strong></p>
<p>Derived quantities and units are those obtained by some simple combination of the fundamental quantities and units. They are thus dependent on the fundamental quantities and units. Examples of derived quantities, their derivation and their units are summarized in Table 1.2.</p>

<h4>1.2 Measurements</h4>
<p>Measurements play a crucial role in physics, but they can never be perfectly precise. We usually note the reading accuracy of the measuring instrument and specify the measurement only in the correct number of significant figures.</p>
<p>In giving the result of a measurement, it is good practice to state the precision or estimated uncertainly in the measurement. For example, we can write the length of a wire as 51.3 &plusmn; 0.1 cm, where 0.1 represents the estimated uncertainty in the measurement. This means that the length is probably between 51.2 and 51.4 cm.</p>
<p>The number of reliably known digits in a number is called the number of significant figures. They are usually taken as all the figures from the first non-zero digit to the last non-zero digit together with the final zeros if they occur after the decimal points. Thus there are four significant figures in 51.35 and two in 0.053 cm. We specify measurements only in the correct number of significant figures. Thus the length of the wire is recorded as 51.3 cm not 51.30 cm. The figure 51.30 implies an uncertainty of 0.01 cm. Significant figures indicate the precision with which a particular measurement has been made.</p>
<h5>1.2.1 Length</h5>
<p>In the secondary school physics laboratory, we can measure length with a metre rule, caliper, vernier callipers, and micrometer screw gauge.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>The metre rule</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The metre rule is graduated in centimetres and millimetres. The smallest graduation of the metre rule is 1 mm or 0.1 cm. This is its reading accuracy. Measurements can be estimated up to half this smallest graduation, i.e. 0.5 mm or 0.05 cm. This is the estimated uncertainty. Thus, we can record a length as 21.55 &plusmn; 0.05 cm.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fig 1.1 Parallax error&nbsp; %%%%016%%%%</p>
<p>In measuring with a metre rule, a necessary precaution is to avoid the error of parallax by looking vertically downwards on the markings instead of slantingly.</p>
<p>Large distances such as length or width of a football field can be measured with steel tapes graduated in metres.</p>
<p>Fig. 1.2 The calipers %%%%018%%%%</p>
<p>Callipers are used to measure lengths on solid objects that are in a cylindrical form. The jaws of the callipers are adjusted until they touch the object in the correct positions. The length between the jaws is then measured on a graduated scale (fig. 1.2b).</p>
<ol>
<li><strong> The vernier callipers</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>These can measure lengths more accurately than the metre rule. To measure small lengths, to the nearest 0.1 nun, e.g. the thickness of a metre rule, the internal and external diameters of a tube, or the diameter of a rod, we use the vernier callipers. This device gives a more accurate determination of such lengths.</p>
<p>The instrument has two sets of jaws and two scales, the main and the vernier scales. The vernier scale which slides on the main scale is a smaller scale which enables us to measure a fraction of the smallest division on the main scale. The main scale is graduated in centimetres and millimetres. The vernier scale is constructed by dividing a 9 mm length into 10 equal intervals such that each vernier division has a length of 0.9 mm or 0.09 cm. The difference in length between a vernier scale division and a main scale division is thus 0.1 mm or 0.01 cm.</p>
<p>Fig. 1.3 Vernier Calliper %%%%020%%%%</p>
<p>Fig. 1.4: Main scale and vernier scale %%%%022%%%%</p>
<p>For any measurement, the readings on both the main and the vernier scales are added together to obtain the total reading of the length. For example in fig. 1.4 the reading is 2.24 cm. This is obtained by recording the reading on the main scale immediately preceding the zero mark on the vernier scale; we then record the number of the graduation on the vernier which comes most directly in line with the graduation on the main scale. This gives the decimal place in millimetres (mm) or the second decimal place in centimetres (cm). The two readings are then added up (22 mm + 0.4 mm).</p>
<p>The vernier callipers can usually measure to an accuracy of 0.01 cm. The necessary precaution in using this instrument is always to note if it has any zero error. This is done by setting the zeros of the main scale and the vernier to coincide. If they do not coincide, any difference is noted as the &lsquo;zero error&rsquo;. This is added or subtracted in all subsequent readings as the case may be. The reading accuracy of the vernier callipers is 0.01 cm.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><strong> The micrometer screw gauge</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>For accurate measurements of still smaller lengths such as the diameter of a wire, the diameter of a small ball (e.g. a pendulum bob) or the thickness of a piece of paper, we use the micrometer screw gauge. It can measure to an accuracy of 0.001 cm.</p>
<p>Before any measurements are made with the screw gauge, its anvil and spindle should be closed to check for zero error.</p>
<p>Like the vernier callipers, the micrometer screw gauge has a main scale and a vernier scale. The main scale is graduated in millimeters. The circular vernier scale consists of 50 equal divisions. When the screw head carrying the circular vernier scale is turned round once, it moves a distance of 0.5 mm along the main scale. Thus one division on the vernier scale equals $\frac{0.5}{50}$ or 0.01 mm on the main scale.</p>
<p>To measure with the instrument, the object is placed between the jaws (i.e. the anvil and the spindle) which are then closed using the ratchet until the object is firmly gripped by the jaws. The main scale reading is then noted to the nearest graduation (7.5 mm in fig. 1 .5a). We then note the reading on the circular vernier scale (25 divisions in fig. 1.5b, i.e. 0.25 mm). The readings on the two scales are then added giving 7.5 + 0.25 = 7.75 mm or 0.775 cm. If the instrument has any zero error, this is then added or subtracted as the case may be.</p>
<p>Fig. 1.5: The micrometer screw gauge&nbsp;&nbsp; %%%%025%%%%</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>1.2.2 Measurement of volume</h5>
<ol>
<li><strong> Rectangular block</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>We can obtain the volume of a rectangular block by measuring its length (1), breadth (b) and height (h). The volume is then given by</p>
<p>V=l x b x h</p>
<p>Fig. 1.6: measuring the volume of an irregular solid %%%%027%%%%</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><strong> Irregular solid</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The volume of an irregular solid (e.g. a glass stopper) is obtained by immersing it completely in a measuring cylinder containing a liquid in which the solid is insoluble. The volume of the liquid displaced, gives the volume of the solid.</p>
<ol>
<li>A sphere</li>
</ol>
<p>We measure the diameter (d) with a micrometer screw gauge and obtain the volume by</p>
<p>V = $\frac{4}{3}$ r3</p>
<p>Where r = $\frac{\text{d}}{2}$ for greater accuracy, we obtain three different values of the diameter and find the mean value.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><strong> Cylindrical wire</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>We measure the length (1) of the wire using a metre rule, and the diameter (d) of the wire using a micrometer screw gauge. We measure the diameter at different points of the wire and calculate the mean diameter.</p>
<p>Volume = r21 or $\pi( \frac{d}{2})$2 1 =&nbsp; $\frac{{{{d}}^{2}}1}{4}$</p>
<ol>
<li><strong> Liquids</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The volume of a liquid can be measured with a measuring cylinder, a pipette or a burette.</p>
<p>Fig. 17.a Graduated glass containers %%%%040%%%%</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The correct liquid level is read at the bottom of the meniscus (or curved surface of the liquid).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>1.2.3 Mass and Weight</h5>
<p>Mass is defined as the quantity of matter or &lsquo;stuff contained in a body; while weight is the force or pull with which the earth attracts the body towards the centre of the earth.</p>
<p>The mass of a body is measured with a balance of which there are various types &mdash; a beam or chemical balance, a lever balance as shown in fig. 1.8.</p>
<p><strong>Different types of balance</strong></p>
<p>The mass of a body is usually measured by comparing it with standard masses.</p>
<p>To measure with a beam balance, the object is placed on the left-hand scale pan and standard masses are placed on the right-hand scale pan. When raised for weighing, the beam of the balance should swing freely about a pivot in the centre of the beam. Standard masses are added until the pointer swings equal number of divisions on each side of the central mark or the pointer balances on the central mark of the scale. When this happens the masses in the two scale pans are equal.</p>
<p>The mass of the object is then obtained by adding the standard masses on the right scale pan.</p>
<p>The working of the beam balance is based on the principle of moments&rsquo; and its reading accuracy could be up to 0.001 grams.</p>
<p>Precautions to be taken when using beam balance</p>
<p>For more accurate results, the following precautions should be observed:</p>
<p>forceps (not bare hands) are used for picking up the standard masses,</p>
<p>objects are wiped dry before being placed on the scale pan,</p>
<p>hot objects are allowed to cool before weighing,</p>
<p>known masses are not added or removed from the scale pan while the beam is in the raised position.</p>
<p>The weight of an object is found with a spring balance. The balance is calibrated using Hooke&rsquo;s Jaw which states that the extension of the spring of the balance is proportional to the applied force as long as the elastic limit of the spring is not exceeded. The balance, therefore, has a uniform scale and measures the weight directly.</p>
<p>The object whose weight is required is suspended from the hook of the spring balance. The weight causes the spring to stretch moving the pointer which directly indicates the weight on the graduated scale.</p>
<p>Fig. 1.9 The spring balance %%%%044%%%%</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Precautions to be taken when using spring balance</strong></p>
<p>For accurate results, we should observe the following precautions:</p>
<ul>
<li>The balance is held still and vertically while taking the reading. It is better to suspend it from a firm support or hook.</li>
<li>The spring is stretched lightly with hand and released before taking readings. This is to remove possible kinks in the spring.</li>
<li>The eye is placed horizontally with the pointer while taking reading. This is to avoid the error due to parallax.</li>
</ul>
<h5>1.2.4 Time</h5>
<p>We define time as that in which events are distinguishable with reference to before and after. The most natural time unit is the solar day which is manifested by the passing of day and night. It takes the earth one solar day to complete one&bull; revolution about its axis. For astronomical purposes, a different time scale known as sidereal time is used. This is the time interval between two successive passages of a star over the meridian. At the present period, the essential mechanisms of the devices used for marking the passage of time are masses so mounted or suspended that when set in motion under the influence of forces, they repeat with great regularity fixed cycles of their motion. The pendulum of a clock and the balance wheel of a watch are two of such mechanisms.</p>
<p>Hence nowadays we measure and indicate time with clocks. In the laboratory, time is measured with a stop-clock or stop-watch.</p>
<p>Fig. 1.10 A Stop-Clock or Stop-Watch %%%%046%%%%</p>
<p>The stop-clock or stop-watch can be started or stopped with the use of a knob. The knob can be pressed or pushed. The stop watch enables us to measure small intervals of time very accurately. Stop watches can measure time to 0.1 second.</p>
<p>The unit of time is the second with its multiple units as</p>
<p>60 seconds = 1 minute</p>
<p>60 minutes = 1 hour</p>
<p>24 hours = 1 day</p>
<p>The most accurate clocks of all are the quartz crystal clock and the atomic clock.</p>
<h4>1.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dimensions of physical quantities</h4>
<p>Any quantity which can be measured in units of lengths is said to have the dimension, of length (L). so also any quantity which can be measured in units of time is said to have a dimension of time (T) and any quantity which can be measured in unit of mass is said to have a dimension of mass (M). in physics, the word dimension has a special meaning. It usually denotes the physical nature of a quantity. The symbols that are used to specify length, mass and time are (L), (M), (T), respectively. They are usually enclosed in bracket.</p>
<p>The dimension of velocity (V) are written</p>
<p>V = $\frac{length}{time}$&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $\frac{L}{T}}$</p>
<p>Or V = (L) (T-1)</p>
<p>Dimension for area, A = length x breadth</p>
<p>= (L) x (L) = (L2)</p>
<p>For volume, V = (L) x (L) x (L) = (L3)</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p>Deduce the dimension of (a) force (b) pressure (c) work</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong><br /> (a) force = mass x acceleration</p>
<p>Dimension of force = Dimension of mass x dimension of acceleration</p>
<p>= (M) x (LT-2)</p>
<p>= (MLT-2)</p>
<p>(b) pressure = $\frac{force}{Area}$ = $\frac{dimension~of~force}{dimension~of ~Area}$</p>
<p>Dimension of pressure = $\frac{MLT^{-2}}{L^{2}}$ = (M-1T-2)</p>
<p>(c) Dimension of work = &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dimension of force x</p>
<p>Dimension of distance</p>
<p>(MLT-2) x (L) = ML2T-2)</p>
<p>We can use the method of dimension or dimensional analysis to verify whether a physical equation is correct or not, For example, consider the formula, V = u + at. The dimension of each term on each side of the equation must be the same.</p>
<p>&nbsp;= $\frac{L}{T}$ = (LT-1)</p>
<p>&nbsp;= $\frac{L}{T^{2}}}$ = (LT-2)</p>
<p>t = T</p>
<p>hence,</p>
<p>v = &nbsp;+ at</p>
<p>(LT-1) = (LT-1) + (LT-2) x (T)</p>
<p>= (LT-1) + (LT-1)</p>
<p>Therefore, the equation is correct dimensionally</p>

<h4>Unit 2</h4>
<h4>Personal Health-Ageing</h4>
<h4>What is age ng?</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ageing can simply be defined as the process of getting old or becoming old. When a child is born. he or she passes through many stages in life for instance he passes through:</p>

For instance, an old man complains of headache &lsquo;today, tomorrow it is backache, the following day it is his legs and muscles. That is why a writer defines ageing as a progressive functional decline or gradual deterioration of physiological function with age, including a decrease in fecundity (fertility).</p>

<h4>Meaning of drug Use Misuse and Abuse.</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Longman&rsquo;s dictionary of Contemporary English explains drug as an illegal substance such as marijuana or cocaine which some people take in order to feel happy, relaxed or excited.</p>
<p>A drug can also be defined as any chemical which affects how your body works or you behave or feel. From all indications all drugs are poisons depending on usage and body constitution.</p>
<p>Medicines are drugs that are used to either speed up or slow down or something about the way your body functions to try to make it work better.</p>
<p>Sometimes they are necessary for the above purposes. Drug could also be seen as any substance other than food. Food here include orange, pawpaw, banana, in fact all edible fruit and water.</p>
<p><strong>Where do Drugs come from?</strong></p>
<p>Some drugs come from plants and others produced in laboratories. Production of drugs, just as in medicine, vanes from place to place. For example, Indian drugs for high blood pressure are not the same as the one produced in the United States for the same purpose.</p>

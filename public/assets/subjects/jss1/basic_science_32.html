<h4>Unit 1</h4>
<h4>Swimming</h4>
<p>Swimming is the art of moving one&rsquo;s body through the water using hands, legs and trunk. It could be seen as propelling the body forward or backward through the water using the arm, feet, hands, trunk, etc. swimming can take place in the following places</p>
<ul>
<li>Stream</li>
<li>Rivers</li>
<li>Lakes</li>
<li>Swimming pool</li>
<li>Seas</li>
</ul>
<p>The main purposes of swimming are to teach the basic survival skills and recreational swimming skills for leisure time use.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Unit 2</h4>
<h4>Basic Swimming Strokes/Styles</h4>
<ol>
<li>These basic strokes or styles include the following:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Craw,</li>
<li></li>
<li>Back stroke.</li>
<li>Butterfly stroke.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The above strokes and styles are popular because they are used in swimming competitions such as Olympics, Common Wealth Games, All African Games, Asian Games, etc. They are most commonly used even during recreation. However, there are other strokes that are not commonly used such as; side stroke, elementary back stroke and trudge.</p>
<p><strong>Front Crawl or Free Style Stroke</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>This style is the fastest of all swimming strokes. The speed is brought about by the alternate movement of the arm and the fast flutter kicks of the legs coupled with sideways turning of the head which makes for efficient breathing pattern.</li>
<li><strong>Breast Stroke:</strong> Breast stroke is performed with every part of the body inside the water with the exception of the head that is at angle of 30&deg; &mdash; 40&deg; with water. The head maintains this posture all through the distance while the legs whip kick and the hands pull the water sideways to gain distance.</li>
<li><strong>Back craw is a reverse of front craw:</strong> Back crawl is reverse of front crawl. In this case the swimmer lies on the water with his back. The arms are stretched backwards and entering the water with the small finger first in an alternate movement. That is, when one arm is about completing the circle the other arm which is beside the body starts moving towards the back of the head for another push which guarantees the swimmer the required speed.</li>
<li><strong>Butterfly stroke:</strong> Butterfly stroke is performed with the face looking down on the water with the arms spread as to fly out of the water and dolphin kick with the legs the swimmer gains a good distance.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Note this clearly:</strong> While the legs perform a dolphin kick, the arms move in a forward circle pulling the water backwards at the same time, this brings forward movement.</p>

<h3>&nbsp;<strong>Bush Burning </strong></h3>
<h4>Unit 1</h4>
<h4>Meaning of Bush Burning</h4>
<p>Bush burning can be defined as a process of setting ablaze trees, grasses, shrubs and other domesticated plants found in the bush. Bush burning whether as a result of wildlife or a controlled bum affects not only the appearance of the landscape but also the quality of the soil in terms of organic matter content and vegetation biodiversity. The landscape may quickly recover after a fire with fresh new growth and emerging seedlings. Bush burning can further be described as the controlled or uncontrolled combustion of &lsquo;frees, shrubs, grasses and domesticated plants.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Unit 2</h4>
<h4>Practices that Influence Bush Burning</h4>
<p>These practices may include social, economic and agricultural practices.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Farming</strong>: The practice of bush burning is deeply ingrained in the traditional farming system involving small-scale farmers who are probably lazy and do not have adequate funds to employ labourers or purchase tractors for land clearing.</li>
<li><strong>Hunting Expedition</strong>: In mostaural of Nigeria especially in the Eastern, Northern and Western parts bush burning is used by hunters to hunt for animals during the dry season or harmattan time. Examples of some bush animals include, monkey, bush rabbit, snakes, gorillas, hyenas, Leopard and so on. These animals when caught are either eaten or sold to make money.</li>
<li><strong>Deliberate Act</strong>. Sometimes people set mischievously. These people my not have any genuine reason for doing so. At times, it could be as a result of burning cigarette stub dropped by smokers.</li>
<li>4<strong>. Malicious Act</strong>: Some people may willfully set other people&rsquo;s agricultural land on fire in order to Cause trouble which may eventually lead to fighting.</li>
<li>5<strong>. Pests and Diseases Control</strong>: The Fulani herdsmen use bush burning as a method in checking pests and diseases in livestock management. Pests like ticks found on the bodies of the cattle or on the soil, rodents and snakes are either killed or driven away by the heat or smoke of the blaze.</li>

<h4>Unit 3</h4>
<h4>Effects of Bush burning</h4>
<p>Bush burning has lot of impact on both the human and the environment. Consequences of uncontrolled bush burning are very obvious in areas characterized by torrential rainfall, strong wind and hot solar radiation. This is because even slight disturbance of the vegetal mantle may have very considerable impact on the organic content and vegetation biodiversity. The following are the economic consequences of bush burning.</p>
<ol>
<li>The huge smoke and ashes soaring in the air during the heat result in pollution of the air and suffocation of people and other animals.</li>
<li>Bush burning produces air pollutants such as carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons "hydrogen sulphide, nitrogen oxides, sulphur oxides, ozone particulates and other oxidants all of which are detrimental to the environment and human health. These substances result from incomplete combustion of cellulose.</li>
<li>Bush burning heats up the soil thereby destroying the nutrients resulting to poor crop yield which can lead to scarcity of food and famine.</li>
<li>The huge smoke and Substances released into the air during the bush bushing can contribute to climate change. Climate change is one of the global Change disturbing the entire world; It affects water resources and agricultural systems.</li>
<li>Bush burning results in green gasses emission leading to global warming. Some greenhouse gases include carbon dioxide, methane oxides of sulphur, oxides of nitrogen and chlorofluorocarbons etc. These substances deplete the ozone layer.</li>
<li>disturbs the ecosystem since some microorganisms are killed.</li>
<li>It leads to the destruction of economic trees, cash crops and animals that should have been allowed to grow.</li>
<li>Bush burning has adverse impact on soil impaction.</li>
<li>It increases the rate of flooding and soil erosion by making the soil structure and texture to be loose, porous and exposed. xi. It affects the soil pH (degree of acidity or alkalinity) by damaging</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Unit 4</h4>
<h4>Regulations against a Bush Burning</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>There should be a serious National Action plan in terms of legislating laws against bush burning both at the state and LG/ levels. Defaulters must be forced to pay a certain amount of money as fine or as an alternative spend some time in prison as a deterrent.</li>
<li>The policy of &ldquo;<strong>plant a tree today</strong>&rdquo; should be enforced in the school system. Tree planting stimulates afforestation and vegetation and prevents desert encouragement.</li>
<li>Government should discourage people from indiscriminate felling of trees. Only duly certified accredited tree fellers should be allowed to cut down trees and replace.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Deforestation 1</strong></p>
<p>Deforestation is defined the clearance or clearing of forest or stands of trees where the land is thereafter converted to non-forest use.</p>
<p>Examples converting forest lands to farms, ranches or urban use. Tropical rainforest is where the most concentrated deforestation activities occur.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h4>Units 5</h4>
<h4>Reasons for Deforestation</h4>
<ul>
<li>Trees are cut down to be sold as fuel (Sometimes in the o of charcoal) or timber (i.e. firewood)</li>
<li>Cleared land may be used pasture for livestock and Cultivation of crops.</li>
<li>Cleared land can also be used for plantation of commodities such as plantain trees, cocoa trees, Palm seedlings etc.</li>
<li>More so, cleared land may be used for settlement like building of houses estates, churches, schools, industrial layout, roads markets or ranches etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Unit 6</h4>
<h4>Causes of Deforestation</h4>
<p>According to the united nations framework of convention of climate change (UNFCC) secretariate, the main causes of deforestation include:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Agriculture:</strong> This is the overwhelming direct cause of deforestation. Research findings show that subsistence farming is responsible for 48% of deforestation, commercial agricultural is responsible for 32% of deforestation, logging is responsible for 15% of deforestation and fuel wood removals make up 5% of deforestation.</li>
<li><strong>Inequitable Distribution of Wealth and Power</strong>: This is one of the causes of deforestation since the poor peasant villagers are more likely to clear forest because they have no alternatives. Thus, they resort to felling down trees to be sold as firewood, charcoal, and timbers etc.</li>
<li><strong>Urbanization and Over-Population</strong>: With increase in population growth, the government may decide to clear the forest for the construction of houses roads, industries, schools, churches and hospitals for use by the teeming population.</li>
<li><strong>Business or Economic incentives:</strong> The high cost of living and also good items in the global market have led people to engage in forest conversion (making use of forest resources rather than forest conservation)</li>
<li><strong>Corruption of Government Institution:</strong> Corrupt government officials could decide to enrich themselves by felling special trees in the states Ministry of Forest Resources and biodiversity conservation.</li>
<li><strong>Cattle Ranching, Industries and Extensive ' Farming</strong>: &lsquo;The government may decide to engage in large-scale cattle ranching and extensive farming. These activities may lead to deforestation. For instance, bushes may be cleared to enable cattle graze.</li>
<li><strong>Globalization:</strong> Globalization is often viewed as another root cause of deforestation. Forests may be Cleared to have space for the construction of aerodromes, super Class international markets, roads, Monasteries/convents etc. Such Structures can attract people from different parts of the world so that they can relate with others when they visit.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Unit 7</h4>
<h4>Effects of Deforestation on the Environment</h4>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Deforestation causes carbondioxide to Inger in the atmosphere</strong>. Usually plants use carbondioxide produced during respiration for photosynthesis. The absence of trees due _ to deforestation will make carbon (iv) to accumulate. As carbondioxide accumulates, it produces a layer in the atmosphere that traps radiation from the sun. The radiation is Converted to heat which causes global warming. This phenomenon is better described as Greenhouse effect.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Green Plants produce oxygen during the process photosynthesis</strong>. Therefore, trees are felled, this reduces amount of oxygen present in the atmosphere for respiration by plants and animals.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>The decay and burning of plants and wood result in release of large amount carbon dioxide. The Carbon contributes greatly to warming. Since it is greenhouse</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gas (GHG).</p>
<ul>
<li>In deforested areas, the land heats up faster and higher temperature, localized upward Motions enhance the formation of clouds and ultimately produce more rainfall.</li>
<li>clearing of forests reduces soil cohesion, thereby resulting in soil erosion, flooding and landslides which frequently degrade into wasteland.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Reforestation Project</h4>
<p>In many parts of the world, especially in East Asian countries, reforestation, (planting young trees to replace felled for a more conducive habitat. frees) and afforestation (planting new trees) projects are increasing the area conservation and deforestation of forested land. In the People&rsquo;s Republic of China for instance, the government has launched a programme requiring every able-bodied citizen between the ages 11-60 years to plant 3-5 trees per year. The government claims that at least 1billion would have been planted every year in China since 1982 when it was first launched. March 12" of every year in China is the planting holiday. This has introduced the Greenwall of China Projection which aims at halting the expansion of the Gobi Desert. China has also embarked on Aerially Delivered Reforestation and Erosion Control System and proposed Sahara Forest Project coupled with the Seawater Greenhouse. However, in Nigeria, we have National Environmental standard and Regulation Enforcement Agency (NESREA).</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Farming:</strong> New farming methods are being developed to farm more intensively such as high-yield hybrid crops greenhouse autonomous building gardens and hydroponics. These methods are often dependent on chemical inputs to maintain necessary yields.</li>
<li><strong>Forest Management:</strong> Effective forest management should be employed so that forest is protected and conserved not converted.</li>
<li><strong>Bush Burning:</strong> There should be legislation against bush burning. It reduces the number of forests growing plants, biodiversity reduction and result in emission of dangerous gases. that enhance global warming.</li>
<li><strong>Renewable Energy Sources:</strong> Alternative sources of fuel such the sun and wind (renewable sources) should be used addition, natural gas and kerosene can as well be used instead of firewood.</li>

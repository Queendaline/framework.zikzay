<h4>Methods of Processing Plastics and Rubber</h4>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Plastics:</strong> Plastics are manufactured through the combination of several different compounds obtained chiefly from Cellulose, coal, and petroleum. There are numerous techniques or methods for producing plastic objects. Some of these are blow moulding, injection moulding, rotational moulding, thermoset moulding, thermoforming, tube, film and sheet extrusion, casting, laminating, calendaring and framed plastics production. Generally, moulding methods involve forcing heated and molten plastic material into a mould which has been | made into the desired shape of the object. A cooling process is used while the plastic material is still in the mould to ensure that the desired shape is retained.</li>
</ol>
<p>Plastic pipes, hoses, and tubes, because of their desired flexibility are usually made of thermoplastic materials and are produced using the technique called extrusion. Extrusion involves feeding plastic granules into a heating chamber where it is turned into liquid. This liquid is then passed into the extrusion mould where forced cooling causes it to solidify. Thermoplastic sheets are usually made using the method called <strong>calendaring</strong>. In this case, plastic material is heated until it becomes a paste. This paste is then passed through a series of rollers, which flatten the paste into large sheets o required thickness. In the vast majority of plastic production techniques, air or water is used for the cooling process.</p>

<li><strong>Rubber: Natural rubber and synthetic rubber </strong>are the two Classes &lsquo;of rubber currently available. Natural rubber is obtained from latex. Latex is a milky fluid which is found under the bark of many tropical trees. However, the free almost exclusively used for commercial Production of latex is the para-rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis).</li>
</ol>
<p>The technique of processing. natural rubber begins by tapping a rubber tree for its latex. Tapping is done by cutting at several points along the erect stem, Narrow channels running for about half the circumference of a tree trunk. These channels are made in a Spiraling manner container into which latex runs are positioned at the outlets of the channels.</p>
<p>After collection, the latex is sieved to remove solid impurities and then mixed with water. Next, the rubber is made to coagulate (thicken) out of the latex by the addition of dilute acetic or formic acid; and they are deposited on aluminum partitions in horizontal tanks. These partitions allow the rubber to be formed as slabs rather than in a single lump. This makes handling easier. The rubber may be further treated into any grade desired. Some grades of natural rubber are pale creep, smoked sheet and skim rubber.</p>
<p><strong>Synthetic Rubber </strong>is processed from organic compounds derived from petroleum. Petroleum is mined from the ground either on land or underneath the sea. There are several synthetic rubbers and they are usually preferred to natural rubbers for certain specialized purposes for example some are more resistant to oil (e.g. acrylonitrile rubber), much less permeable to air (e.g. butyl rubber) and withstand higher temperatures (e.g. silicone rubber) than natural rubber. Some other synthetic rubbers are butadiene, polyisoprene, polysulfide ethylene &mdash;propylene, and vedox.</p>

<h4>Uses of rubber and rubber plastics&nbsp;</h4>
<ul>
<li>it is used for chairs and tables in our homes and offices.</li>
<li>It is used as container bags in super markets and as a pure water Ceiling Container</li>
<li>It is used in engines of cars where intense heat is not needed.</li>
<li>It is used where heat is not experienced like the rotor etc.</li>
<li>It is used as body fender for cars of recent.</li>
<li>It is used as body parts for most of our musical instruments, piano, flutes, speakers etc</li>
</ul>

<h5>Rubber</h5>
<ul>
<li>Rubber is used as shock absorber in our vehicles.</li>
<li>It is used to absorb sound.</li>
<li>It is used to absorb light. iv. ft is used to carry the engine of motor car and other heavy weight.</li>

<h3>RESOURCES FROM NON-LIVING THINGS</h3>
<h3>Topic: Resources from Non-Living Things: Solid Minerals.</h3>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Nigeria is richly endowed with a variety of natural liquid and solid mineral resources. The liquid resource is basically petroleum (or crude oil). Following the discovery of crude oil, the attention of past and present governments shifted away from looking for other alternative sources of income to Nigeria. Thus, the exploration and exploitation of solid in Nigeria; mineral resources such as gold, limestone, coal, iron, tin etc. which have the potentials of improving our economy was neglected. In this topic, we shall learn about the solid minerals Nigeria; their, locations and economic importance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Unit 1</h4>
<p>Resources from Non-Living Things (Solid Minerals)</p>
<p>Definition: A mineral is a naturally occurring substance (as ore, diamond, gold) obtained from the ground usually for humans to use. A mineral could also be defined as a substance found naturally in the soil in form of solid, liquid and gas. Minerals can be extracted or dug or mined from the soil or earth for human use.</p>
<p>The scientific study of minerals and their extractions is known as Mineralogy. Examples of solid minerals are diamond, gold, limestone, quartz, tin, coal, salt, zinc. Do you appreciate the fact that the rocks and Soils we have today are formed from minerals? An example of edible minerals is</p>
<p>salt (common salt). The Federal Ministry of Solid Mineral Resources is in charge for the production of solid minerals. The Nigeria Mining Corporation is a parastatal that spearheads the extraction of solid minerals.</p>

<h4>Unit 2</h4>
<h4>Some examples of Solid Minerals, their location, and Economic importance</h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>Limestone/calcium (Ca)</strong>: Limestone is a white solid substance which does not occur in the free state but in combined form. Its common name is limestone while its IUPAC nomenclature is <strong>calciumtrioxocarbonate(iv)</strong>, (CaCO<sub>3</sub>). Its other common name is <strong>calcium carbonate</strong>. It also occurs in other forms such as marble chalk, calcite, &lsquo;coral (or shells of snail tortoise), Aragonite. Limestone is mined by the method called <strong>quarrying</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Locations</strong>: Large deposits of Limestone are Found in the following locations: Edo in Ukpilla, Sokoto - Sokoto, Enugu-Nkalagu, Cross River-Calabar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Economic Importance or Uses or Limestone</h5>
<p>&nbsp;Some of the uses of limestone include:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is used in the manufacture the cement.</li>
<li>It is used in the industrial production of sodiumtrioxocarbonate (iv)Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub></li>
<li>It&rsquo;s used in glass manufacture.</li>
<li>It is used in steel production</li>
<li>It is used in quicklime production</li>
<li>It is used as a filter in paints.</li>
<li>it provides calcium oxide used to remove impurities called slag during the extraction of iron.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Gold:</strong> is a solid mineral and a chemical element. It is very precious throughout the world. It is widely distributed normally in low concentrations globally. The production of gold in Nigeria started in 1913 and reached its peak in 1943 when about 1.4 tonnes of gold was produced. Gold occurs in = an uncombined form. That is, it occurs in the free state.&nbsp; <strong>Location</strong>: In Nigeria, gold is found in llesha in Osun State; Zaria (Zamfara State and Bida (Niger Stade) etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Importance of Gold (Au)</h5>
<p>The following are some of the uses of gold:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is used in making coins and jewellery</li>
<li>It is also used to make wrist watches and foot wears.</li>
<li>It increases per capita income of a nation.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Coal</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Coal is a black solid mineral. It is a source of fuel and energy. It is formed from remains of big trees and vegetation which were buried under the ground millions of years ago under very great pressures and temperatures in the absence of air. In the process, the buried trees undergo complex chemical and physical changes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Types Of coal are: peal like coal, lignite, Bituminous and Anthracite coal.</h5>
<p><strong>Destructive Distillation of Coal:</strong></p>
<p>This is the heating of coal in the absence of air. Some of the Products are coal gas, coke, coal tar, benzene and sulphur(iv) oxide etc,</p>
<h5>Economic Importance of Coal</h5>
<p>Coal has many important uses in the world and the most significant uses are in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Generation of electricity: Coal is a more stable source of energy.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Steel production (use of coke)</li>
<li>Cement manufacturing</li>
<li>Coal gasification and liquefaction (coal-to-liquid) are also important uses of coal for producing synthetic fuel.</li>
<li>Sleam coal also known as thermal coal is mainly used to power stations, driving locomotives, heating homes and power factories and filing industrial boilers.</li>
<li>Bituminous coal is used to produce coke for making cast iron, steel and other industrial process heating.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Lead:</strong> Lead is a soft, heavy grey metal which melts easily. It is poisonous. Naturally, it occurs in the Combined state. The main ore of lead is (leadsulphide) Galena</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Location</strong>: In Nigeria lead is found in Ogoja in Cross River State and Abakiliki in Ebonyi State.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h5>Economic Importance</h5>
<ul>
<li>It is used in the manufacture lead-acid batteries.</li>
<li>It is also used in making alloys (a mixture of two or more metals) such as fusible metals, antifriction metals, plumbers&rsquo; solder, and type metal etc.</li>
<li>It is used for making bullets, lead shots and weights for scientific researches and experiments.</li>
<li>It is used in manufacturing roofing sheets because if is resistant to corrosion and very cheap too.</li>
<li>It is used for making water and gas pipes.</li>
<li>In radioactivity, (spontaneous disintegration of some heavy atomic nuclei into smaller substances or masses) it is used as a shield against x-rays and other radiations.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong> Tin </strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Tin occurs mainly as the ore known as cassiterite or tinstone which is chemically called tin(iv)oxide (SnO<sub>2</sub>). It is a white (silvery) metal in colour, soft and ductile. Tin was first mined in Nigeria in 1903 and is non-poisonous.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Location: </strong>Large deposits of tin ore are found in Jos, plateau state and Kano.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h5>Economic importance of Tin</h5>
<ul>
<li>It is used for making alloys such as soft solder (tin and lead) Bronze (tin and copper) and phosphor bronze, pewter etc.</li>
<li>It takes a high polish and is used to coat other metals to prevent corrosion or rusting such as tin cans which are made of tin-coated iron and steel. Tin-plating is necessary for the canning of foods and drinks in food and beverage industries.</li>
<li>Tin foils are used to wrap food e.g. cheese, cake, moi-moi, meat pie etc.</li>
<li>Tin is used to make toothpaste tubes.</li>
<li>it is used in manufacturing automobile radiators and electrical equipment.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="6">
<li><strong> iron </strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Iron occurs in nature as ores. The common ores are haematite (iron. (iii)oxide, Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), iron pyrites (FeS<sub>2</sub>) and limonite (FeO (OH). The main iron ore is magnetite (or magnetic iron, oxide). It is extracted from its ore in a blast furnace in which very hot air is passed. After a series of chemical reaction, iron is produced as the system loses heat. The three types of iron produced are fig iron, cast iron and wrought iron, wrought iron Is the purest and strongest form.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Location</strong>: In Nigeria, extensive deposits of mon are found in the Itakpe and Ajabonoko hills between Okene and Lokoja in Kwara State.</p>
<h5>Uses of iron</h5>
<ul>
<li>It is used to make lamp posts and iron pipes.</li>
<li>it is used in the construction of door, window protectors and nails, multi-storey buildings, bridges, farming equipment.</li>
<li>It is used in making ornamental iron gates, buckets, pistons, chars, Chains, crane hooks.</li>
<li>It is used to make body parts of motor vehicles, machinery and other tools.</li>
<li>For making drilling, welding and Cutting implements.</li>
<li>For the manufacture of cutlery.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="7">
<li><strong> Kaolin</strong></li>

<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Doors:</strong> A door is a solid flat barrier that closes the entrance to a building or a room. Its principal function is to prevent unrestricted access to an enclosed space. A door way consists of a movable slab, which is called leaf, and the frame to which it is attached. A door may be made of wood, metal, glass or any other solid material or their combinations. The door may be opaque as to prevent see-through vision, translucent as to permit the passage of light or transparent as to permit seeing through it.</li>
</ol>
<p>Doors are grouped in two ways in accordance with the type of material they are made of and the manner. in which they are operated. There are different types under each group. Among those grouped according to materials, that have the wooden doors to be its commonest type used in residential houses. These may take the form of solid carved and beautifully decorated slabs or rectangular frames covered on both sides with sheets of plywood.</p>
<p>Glass doors are largely used in shops, supermarkets, hotels, and other such places where impression of elegance is to be decorated.</p>
<p>Transparent glass doors are beautifully used in architecture in order to create interior lighting effects in buildings. Metal doors find much use in buildings where considerate security is needed such as in banks and prisons, they almost exclusively take the form of heavy steel slabs welded to strong frames. Metal doors are also increasingly being used in homes. Doors grouped according to the manner in which they are operated are more varied.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>The common Types in this Group are the following:</h5>
<ol>
<li><strong>Pivoted or Hinged Door:</strong> The pivoted or hinged door is the most predominant. In this case, the leaf is hinged on one side of the frame and this may be the left, right, or top post. Usually, the length can be hinged between 90&deg; and 180&deg; tum about the post. A pivoted door may be installed vertically or inclined in a wall, or horizontally in a floor. Some pivoted doors set in large openings have leaves hinged on opposite sides of the frame.</li>
<li><strong>Sliding Door: </strong>Sliding door move horizontally along grooves. some cases, they are supported rollers so that they glide easily al their grooves. They are used notably separate rooms in the interior buildings.</li>
<li><strong>Revolving Door: </strong>Revolving doors held on an axis passing through centres. They rotate in.one di about their axis</li>
<li><strong>Dutch Door: </strong>The Dutch door consists of two leaves. The upper leaf may be independently opened while the lower leaf is closed. It is sometimes used at the entrances of shops or stores. It allows goods to be passed through the opening but denies passage through it.</li>
<li><strong>Revolving Door: </strong>revolving doors are held on an axis passing through the centres. They rotate in one direction about their axis.</li>
<li><strong>Rolling Door.</strong> Rolling doors move up Baa and down along grooves.</li>
<li><strong>Folding Door:</strong> A folding door as its name implies folds or stretches horizontally along grooves.</li>
<li><strong>Self-Opening Door: </strong>A modem type of door is the self-opening door used mostly in hotels, airports, and exclusive shops. The person approaching the door breaks a light ray. This activates a mechanism, which opens the door. The door also closes of its own accord. It may be hinged or sliding.</li>
</ol>

<h5>&nbsp;Windows</h5>
<p>A window is an opening in a wall designed for the purpose of admitting light and air into an enclosed space. Most windows are covered Casement with translucent materials or transparent materials. In which case, the window whether closed or open admits light through itself. Transparent materials further permit see-through vision. Such materials are mostly glass or special plastics. Some windows are also covered with Opaque materials such as wood or metal. In this case, the windows can only perform their functions when they are open. There are some windows designed to be normally closed. These ones serve only the purpose of illumination, the use of such windows is limited to air-conditioned spaces. Windows which can be opened perform the function of ventilation. Stained glass windows for creating colour effects are also used in churches, museums, and others. A typical window consists of a number of parts. The casing is the frame in which the window Is set. The sides of the casing are called jambs, A sill and a lintel are respectively located at the bottom and top of slanting members. The movable part of window is called <strong>sash. </strong>There is a wide variety of materials such as timber, glass, metal or combination of materials used on buildings. Some of them are more common than the others. Among the common ones are following:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Casement Windows: </strong>A casement window has one or more sashes pivoted on jambs about which they can rotate. Casement window operates much like hinged doors.</li>
<li><strong>Louvered Window:</strong> A louvered window A window is made up of a number of horizontal glass panes called louvers fixed to pivots. A lever arrangement is used to open or close the window. The louvers may be opened to a desired.</li>
<li><strong>Double-hung Window: </strong>A double-hung window contains two sashes, which can slide up and down. It is operated by means of a cord or chain, which runs over pulleys are hidden in the casing of window.</li>
<li><strong>Awning Window: </strong>A window which, has three or more horizontal sashes, each pivoted at its top in such a way that it can open outward is called the awning window. These sashes act like the eaves of a roof in that they direct rain away from the wall.</li>
<li><strong>Dormer Window:</strong> A type of window which is cut through the roof of a building is known as dormer window. A dormer window is covered by a small roof of its own.</li>
<li><strong>French Window:</strong> A French window (also called French door) reaches the door, and for this reason can allow movement of persons through itself.</li>
<li><strong>Fixed window:</strong> A fixed window does not open. For this reason, fixed windows fulfil only the function of illumination.</li>
<li><strong>Bay Window:</strong> Bay window consists of a series of individual windows placed side by side and projecting from wall.</li>
<li><strong>Bow window:</strong> If bay window is arranged in curved fashion, it is referred to as bow windows.</li>
<li><strong>Oriel window: </strong>when bay and bow windows are located on floor other than the ground floor, they are known as oriel windows.</li>
</ol>
<p>Other types of windows, though less commonly used are <strong>sliding windows </strong>which operates like sliding doors.</p>

<p>Introduction:&nbsp; There are different types of building namely residential, commercial, office, recreational, farm, factory, sports and work shop buildings. Each of these buildings calls for specific design requirements dependent on the purpose for which the building is to serve.</p>
<p>Buildings are designed to provide shelter for the performance of various kinds of human activities. However, a requirement common to all buildings is that they must contain facilities, which will ensure the convince is of people who will occupy them. Such facilities are referred to as building services.</p>
<p>Building services may be divided into two groups. The first group consists of those facilities without which occupying a building will be particularly difficult or almost impossible. Such services are plumbing system, access road, and electrical energy supply.</p>
<p>In the second group are those, which though may not appear &sect; absolutely essential, nevertheless contribute towards making life more pleasant for the occupants of the building. These include telephone, air conditioning, elevators in tall buildings, fire-fighting gadgets, mosquito netting, window, burglary proofs, and pied gas supply.</p>

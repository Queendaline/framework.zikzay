<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Sailors and explorers from ancient time have used magnets to lead you or to guide them to a specific direction over unknown seas and lands. This magnet is known as a <strong>lodestone/loadstone </strong>which is a natural magnet (magnetic iron oxide).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Unit 1</h4>
<h4>Meaning of Loadstone</h4>
<p><strong>Alodestone or Loadstone</strong> is a naturally magnetized piece of the mineral magnetite. They are naturally occurring magnets, which can attract iron. Loadstone is one of the only two minerals that is found naturally magnetized; the other one is <strong>pyrrhotite</strong> this one is a weak magnet. %%%%029%%%% <strong>Fig 10.1 loadstone attracting nails</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>A <strong>magnet </strong>is defined as any material capable of attracting both steel and iron materials and can equally repel while Magnetic materials: are materials that can be attracted by a Magnet. Example: cobalt, iron, nickel and certain alloys.</p>
<p>Some objects are not attracted by magnets, they are called nonmagnetic materials or substances. Example; wood, glass, _ plastics, copper, brass, paper, thread, cotton wool, etc. A magnetic substance can be made into a magnet, but a nonmagnetic substance cannot be made into a magnet. The ends of a magnet where the attracting power is greatest are called the poles. The pole which points towards the north is called the North (N) pole of the magnet, while the other one is called the South (S) pole. %%%%032%%%%<strong>Fig.10 showing the North (N) and South</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>(S) pole of a magnet</strong></p>
<p>The same poles of a magnet are called like poles, while different poles are called unlike poles. If the North pole of a magnet is brought closer to the North pole of another magnet, repulsion occurs, but if North pole is brought near to the South pole of another magnet, attraction occurs. %%%%033%%%%<strong>Fig 10.2a</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Unit 2</h4>
<h4>Laws of Magnetism</h4>
<p><strong>The law states that</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Like Poles Repel and Unlike Poles attract each other.</li>
<li>Equality of Poles of Magnets: the pole strength at the two ends of a magnet is always equal in magnitude but opposite in nature</li>
<li>Inseparability of Poles: - if a bar &lsquo;magnet is actually cut into two parts; each part becomes an independent magnet having two opposite poles. (N and S).</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Unit 3</h4>
<h4>Magnetic Field</h4>
<p>The field of a magnet is a region around a magnet in which the effect/influence of the magnet can be felt or detected. Although, this field cannot be seen, its presence can be demonstrated and mapped out using compass needle. Such a needle when placed near the magnet will swing around and settle in a definite direction showing that a sort of force is present. The compass needle is a sensitive instrument for finding the direction of the magnetic field.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: the direction of the field or line of magnetic force at any point is taken as the direction in which N-pole placed at that point will tend to move.</p>

<p><strong>Unit 4 </strong></p>
<p><strong>Patterns of Magnetic Field </strong></p>
<p>Magnetic field patterns can conveniently be observed using iron fillings. The magnet is placed on a paper and the iron fillings are sprinkled lightly on the paper around the magnet. The paper is now tapped gently and the iron fillings will be seen to tum and settle in definite directions.</p>

<h4>Unit 5</h4>
<h4>Characteristics of Magnetic Lines of Force</h4>
<ul>
<li>lines of force are continuous and will always form closed loops.</li>
<li>Magnetic lines of force do not cross each other.</li>
<li>Parallel magnetic lines of force travelling in the same direction repel one another.</li>
<li>Magnetic lines of force tend to shorten themselves, therefore, the magnetic lines of force. existing between two unlike poles cause the poles to be' pulled together.</li>
<li>Magnetic lines of force pass through all materials, both magnetic and non-magnetic.</li>
<li>Magnetic lines of force always enter or leave a magnetic material at right angles to the surface.</li>
<li>Magnetic lines of force emanate from the N-Pole and enter the S-Pole</li>
</ul>
<h4>Unit 6</h4>
<h4>Identification of Polarity of a Magnet</h4>
<p>There are three methods by which the poles of a magnet can be identified.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>By Iron fillings:</strong> - when a bar magnet is brought closer to iron fillings, the iron fillings tend to concentrate more at the North - pole than the South - pole.</li>
<li><strong>By free suspension: </strong>- when a bar magnet is freely suspended, it will settle in a North &mdash; South direction. The end that points to the North or North seeking is marked North while the -end that points to the South is labeled South.</li>
<li><strong>By Repulsion:</strong> - if two unmarked bar magnets are brought together, if there is attraction, we label one end North and the other South, but if the end of one of the other magnets is reversed, and repulsion occurs, then we know that both are like poles. We either label them North &mdash; North or South &mdash; South. Therefore, repulsion is the only sure way for identifying the polarity of a magnet.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Unit 7</h4>
<h4>Demagnetization</h4>
<p>Demagnetization is a process by which a magnet loses its magnetic property. Demagnetization is the removal of magnetism from a magnetic material. Or simply put, it is the process by which the magnetic property of magnet is removed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Methods of Demagnetization&nbsp;</h5>
<ol>
<li><strong>Heating method:</strong> - when a magnet is heated until it is red hot and placed in and East &mdash; West (E &mdash; W) direction, the magnetic property is lost and would no more behave like a magnet.</li>
<li><strong>Hammering method: </strong>- when the magnet is repeatedly hammered, the arrangement of its magnetic properties is disorganized and the magnetic property is lost.</li>
<li><strong>Electrical method:</strong> - by connecting the magnet to a source of electricity and after some seconds, the magnetic property would be taken away. This is the best way of demagnetizing a magnet.</li>
<li>Keepers are soft iron pieces kept between the poles of permanent magnets while they are stored. Keepers are placed across each end of a pair of bar magnet placed with opposite poles next to each other to help reduce self-demagnetization of magnets.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Unit 8</h4>
<h4>Types of Magnets</h4>
<p><strong>Temporary magnet:</strong> - This one can be easily magnetized and equally easily demagnetized once the magnetic material is removed.</p>
<p>Example; soft iron and electromagnets. Temporary magnets are used in the following devices; electric bells, induction devices, coils, telephone earpiece, magnetic relay, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Permanent Magnet:</strong> a permanent magnet is one which takes time for the magnetic properties to be rearranged and it retains its magnetism longer than a temporary magnet. Example: electric motor, direct current dynamo, radio loud speakers, aerials of transistors etc.</p>

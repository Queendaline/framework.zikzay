<h3>Linear motion</h3>
<p>There are always two types of motions in Engineering. The first one is called linear or straight motion while second one is known as rotary motion. Examples of linear motion are locks, the type of a car moving on a road, a rod that chides on another rod going to and fro in a slot.</p>
<p><strong>Linear may simply be </strong>may simply be explained as motion in a straight line.</p>
<p>In order to obtain a linear motion, the machine elements must be hinged. Let us examine the two rectangular blocks X and Y. Block X is slotted to accommodate block Y. If block X is fixed and block Y is made to slide in the direction of arrow PQ it will be observed that it has made only a straight-line motion. This type of arrangement is known as a complete constraint.</p>
<p>A circular bar is fixed into a circular hole. In this case, if we try to slide, the bar will not only slide but will also turn freely in the hole. This arrangement is said to be an <strong>incomplete constraint.</strong></p>
<p>In most cases, however, it is described that there should be a complete constraint between machine elements. The surface of contact must be formed as to achieve this objective. In the Sliding pair block X should encase &lsquo;block Y so that any lateral motion will be impossible. Also, in the turning pair, with a shaft and bearing arrangement, the shaft must be provided with collars at both ends of the bearing to prevent any side motion.</p>

<p>As in previous examples, slides and slots are equally useful for the production of linear motion. Let us consider door bolt. The bolt is fixed permanently to the door while the operating rod is made to slide in the slot of the bolt to and fro.</p>

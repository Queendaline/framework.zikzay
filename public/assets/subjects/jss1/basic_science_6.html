<h3>Resources from living things</h3>
<p>Living things comprise animals and plants. Plants and animals are very useful to man because they provide man with food, clothing raw materials for building, medicine and clothing These useful things which man derives from plants and animals are called resources. Natural resources like coal and petroleum (crude oil) are derived from dead aquatic plants and animals. These are sources of manure and contribute to soil enrichment and fertility. In this unit, we shall learn about the main resources human beings derive from plants and animals and their importance.</p>

<h4>Unit 1</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;Resources from Living Things</h4>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Resources from living things can be defined as those useful materials we obtain from plants and animals such as food clothing and medicine just to mention but a few.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Resources from Plants</h5>
<p>We derive many resources from plants which may be grouped as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Food crops</li>
<li>Industrial crops</li>
<li>Medicinal crops</li>
<li>Wood crops</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h5>These are further discussed:</h5>
<h5>&nbsp;Food Crops</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Green plants manufacture their own food in the presence of energy from the sun through the process of photosynthesis. Hence green plants are referred to as food producers. There are special of the Where the manufactured food stored. These parts include leaves seeds and roots etc These edible parts of plants are called vegetables which can be grouped as. follows</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Leafy Vegetables</strong>. These are mainly the edible leaves of plants Some of the leaves are eaten in their raw form such as Spinach, lettuce cabbage, celery, All, these can be put together and eaten as salads. However, others are eaten cooked such as waterleaf, bitter-leaf, fluted pumpkin (ugu) and so on.</li>
<li>F<strong>ruits:</strong> Fruits are very important to man because they provide us with vitamins, water and mineral salts. These give protection to the body against infections and also fruits contain sugar which. when metabolized can give energy to the body. Examples of fruits are pawpaw, mango, orange apple, garden egg, pineapple, lemon, lime, &ldquo;banana, ogbono, ukpo, mato, okro, cashew fruit, guava, pepper, fig tree and so on.</li>
<li><strong>Seeds/Grains:</strong> The seeds ang grains/cereals of plants are most eaten cooked. They are very important because they are sources of starch fat and protein Examples of such plants with seeds or grains are maize wheat, rice, beans, sorghum, groundnut, barley, guinea com, cowpea and soya bean etc</li>
<li><strong>Underground Crops</strong>: The foods stored in these crops make them to look swollen and usually found in the soil. These consists of stem-tubers, root-tubers, bulb, com, rhizome etc. They are mostly eaten cooked but some can be used as spices.</li>
<li><strong>Oil Plants</strong>: These are plants that mainly provides us with vegetable oil for cooking and for other purposes. Examples are coconut, groundnut, soya bean, cotton, oil palm, shear butter and castor oil.</li>
</ol>
<h5>Industrial crops</h5>
<p>These are crops grown for their various industrial applications.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Crops for textile industry: </strong>Cotton plant provides cotton fibre used to make pillows, cloths, mattresses, thread and so on. This plant is mostly grown in the northern part of Nigeria. Winnowing trays and baskets are made from the bark of bamboo palm while the trunk is used to make local beds.</li>
<li><strong>Cosmetic Industry:</strong> Cosmetics are makeups substances which are applied on the body mainly on the skin in order to improve natural features of an individual and protect the skin from dryness. Some of the cosmetics are: Lali or Lallee, Camwood powder &ldquo;Uhe&rdquo; (Igbo) or &ldquo;Oshun&rdquo; (Yoruba) etc.</li>
<li><strong>Bakery industry: </strong>Bakery industry uses wheat. flour to make chin-chin, bread, cake etc. Maize flour is also used to make similar products.</li>
<li>Yeast, a non-green plant (fungus) is used to make bread rise (dough) during bakery.</li>
<li>Yeast is also used for fermentation during alcohol production (beer).</li>
<li>Maize is used to make alcohol in beer production.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h5>Medicinal Crops</h5>
<p>These are crops grown mainly for their medicinal values. Their roots, barks, leaves are used as drugs for the treatment of various ailments/disease. Examples are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Penicillium (a fungus) is a non-green plant used to produce antibiotic, penicillin for treating diseases including the eye. Some of the plants are used to heal wounds, to cure indigestion, constipation, laxatives (soften stool) and to control stooling. For example,</li>
<li>&ldquo;dogonyaro&rdquo; is used for the treatment of malaria.</li>
<li>Bitter kola is used to treat stomach upset especially in children. It is also used in the treatment of cough and high blood pressure.</li>
<li>Bitter kola has the capacity to block everything poisonous coming into the body.</li>
<li>Aloe Vera plant heals wounds and stomach problems.</li>
<li>Nchanwu (Igbo) has been found very useful in the treatment of jadi jadi (in children) food seasoning and also for fightng high blood pressure and diabetes</li>
<li>Bitter leaves can be used in the treatment of minor cuts wounds to aid blood clot.</li>
<li>Bryophylum plants stops inflammation.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h5>Wood Crops</h5>
<p>These are plants that provide us with hardwood (timber) and soft wood.</p>
<p>Wood crops that are naturally hard and tough are called hardwoods.</p>
<p>Examples are iroko, ebony, mahogany, obeche, camphor and so on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Cash Crops</h5>
<p>These are Crops usually grown for sale in order to make money. Examples are groundnut, coconut, cocoa, rubber, coffee, tobacco, kola nu, cotton, oil palm etc.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h4>Unit 2</h4>
<h4>Resources from Animals</h4>
<p>Animals provide us with food rich in protein for growth and repair of dead and worm-out tissues. The keeping of animals for food and/or sale is called livestock farming are cow, goat, sheep, buffalo, snail, pig, chicken (bird) and so on.</p>
<h5>Importance of Livestock Farming</h5>
<ol>
<li><strong>Aquaculture/Fish farming: </strong>Aquaculture means fish farming. It refers to the growing or rearing of fishes, crab, crayfish, prawn and other water organisms in an artificial or man-made water bodies known as fish ponds. The practice of aquaculture is mainly to produce large quantities of fish for people to eat and produce beautiful coloured fish to be kept in home aquarium and ponds as decoration. Fishery is an aspect of aquaculture that deals on rearing fish alone.</li>
<li><strong>Poultry keeping:</strong> The term &ldquo;poultry&rdquo; refers to all species of domesticated birds. it is the science of raising birds such as chicken, guinea fowl, turkey, duck, pigeon and goose. Poultry is raised mainly for money, meat and eggs. poultry also provides poultry dung used by farmers for enriching soil fertility. Other products include feathers for making pillows, materials and as ornamentals won the caps of titled men<strong>.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Diary Farming: </strong>This is the practice whereby animals are reared mainly for the purpose of milk production and may be salvaged for meat after milking. They usually have well-developed udder and teats and a docile temperature. Animals like cows, buffalos, goat, sheep, horses are reared for this purpose.</li>
<li><strong>Hides and Skins:</strong> Hides are skins which are also obtained from livestock. &ldquo;Hide" is the skin of large animals like cow, horse, camel etc while &ldquo;skin&rdquo; is the skin of small animals such as goat, sheep, ram and so on. Hides and skins provide us with mainly leather as a product.</li>
<li><strong>Beast of Burden:</strong> These are animals kept for labour and or series such animals include: donkey, elephant or horses, mule, camels. They give such services as carrying loads, transportation, recreation, pulling a plow, ploughing or doing any other heavy work. This practice is common in the northern part of Nigeria such as Sokoto, Yobe, Adamawa, Bauchi, Kano and so on.</li>

<h4>Economic Importance of Resources from living things to Self-Development</h4>
<ol>
<li>Man is provided with sufficient food for healthy growth and development.</li>
<li>They provide man with certain drugs for the preservation and treatment of some diseases; this prolongs the life of man.</li>
<li>The provide opportunities for self-employment such as poultry, fishery piggery, snailry, etc</li>
<li>They raise the standard of living of a person as the products are sold for money. It creates wealth.</li>
<li>They provide parents money to be able to train their children in education.</li>
<li>Resources from living things provide man with materials for shelter and clothing.</li>
<li>Man uses materials for sports, farming and transport especially across the hot.</li>
<li>The manure, animal droppings enrich the soil and increase plant/crop yield.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>&nbsp;Economic Importance of Resources from Living things to Societal Development</h5>
<p>They are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Bakeries and other food processing industries provide enough food for growing population.</li>
<li>The rapid springing up of Industries bring about urbanization and development.</li>
<li>They create job opportunities for the teaming unemployed youth into such industries as brewery, bakery, tobacco, dairy factories, textiles, beverages etc.</li>
<li>Cash crops are foreign exchange earners to the country, thus increasing the gross domestic product (GDP) of the country hence improving standard of living.</li>
</ol>
<p>The money from the products could be used to pay taxes and the government uses the money derived from tax payment for the provision of social amenities for national development.</p>

<h4>Unit 1</h4>
<h4>Types of diseases and their mode of transmission</h4>
<p><strong>Disease: </strong>This could be defined as the malfunctioning of an organism be it human, plant, or animal. It could be seen as when the body is ill.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h5>Types of diseases</h5>
<p>There many types of diseases. Some are caused by <strong>nutrient deficiency </strong>such as kwashiorkor, pellagra, rickets, beriberi, etc. Others are caused by pathogens i.e. bacteria, virus, fungi and so on, resulting in diseases like Sexually Transmitted Infections (STI), Human Immune Virus (HIV). Yet there are other diseases caused by disease vectors. Such diseases include; malaria, typhoid, cholera, lassa fever.</p>
<h5>Definition of terms</h5>
<p><strong>Disease vectors:</strong> These are agents such as mosquitoes, house flies, Tse-Tse fly, mice, etc, can transfer germs directly or indirectly to another person.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Rickets</strong> (<strong>Osteomalacia)</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>This is a vitamin D deficiency disease. It can be caused by the absence of vitamin D, calcium, phosphorus in diet. It is most common in children between 3 months to 18 months. Bones and teeth do not develop well. The long bones ie. Tibia, femur may bend resulting in bow leg.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Symptoms<strong>:</strong> Restlessness, irritability, weight loss, soft bones resulting in bow leg.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Prevention:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Pregnant mothers should eat food rich in-calcium and phosphorus</li>
<li>Sunbathing is important</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h4>Unit 3</h4>
<h4>The Housefly</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>The Life cycle of the housefly</h5>
<p>The housefly otherwise called the common housefly is a common fly in the tropics e.g. Nigeria. They are everywhere particularly dirty environment and dirty things for example faeces, refuse dumps, decayed materials. Because of the nature of its breeding place and its hairy nature it finds it easy to pick discharge from any disease carrier.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Eggs.</h5>
<p>&nbsp;As soon as the female housefly matures it starts to lay eggs, a common sight for this is the compost manure, faeces, etc. The eggs are usually laid in batches of 50, 100, 200 which take about twenty-four hours to hatch. This depends on the temperature of the environment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Larva Stage:</h5>
<p>The larva or the maggot is the product of the hatched eggs. They are usually 1cm in length and Sluggish in movement. This makes them fall prey to reptile (lizard), fowls, birds, etc. As the larva continues to feed on the organic matters around it, it is transformed into another stage called pupa.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Pupa Stage</h5>
<p>At this stage the larva shortens and becomes brownish, hard and dormant. After about four days the final stage referred to as Adult or Imago.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h5>Adult Stage</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The adult fly craws out of pupa stage and after few hours flies away. Note the whole cycle takes about 3-4 weeks depending on the temperature of the environment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

<h4>Unit 4</h4>
<h4>Control measures of disease vectors; Housefly</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since the housefly is responsible for the distribution of many pathogens that cause diseases it is necessary to make sure that they don&rsquo;t come near us. The measures include:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Education- both old and young must be taught the danger of having housefly in our homes.</li>
<li>Water drainage system must not be blocked to allow free of water.</li>
<li>Defecation must not be in the bush.</li>
<li>Fumigation of our homes and surrounding must be a priority.</li>
<li>Compost manure must be prepared in the farm and not anywhere near the house.</li>
<li>Dustbins should be evacuated on daily basis.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h4>Unit 5</h4>
<h4>STI/STD</h4>
<p><strong>STI- </strong>Is written in full as Sexually transmitted Infection while STD means Sexually Transmitted Disease. They are sometimes referred to as veneral Diseases (VD) or social disease (SD). STI/STD may be used interchangeably for your level.</p>
<p>Some STIs include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gonorrhea</li>
<li>Syphilis</li>
<li>Chlamydia</li>
<li>Genital herpes</li>
<li>HIV/AIDS</li>
<li>Trichomoniasis etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>The diseases are either caused by bacteria, viruses or parasites.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Diseases because they are spread through sexual intercourse However</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>General symptoms and signs</h5>
<ul>
<li>Discharge from the vaginal orifice and penis</li>
<li>Ulcers</li>
<li>Pelvic pain</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h4>Unit 6</h4>
<h4>HIV/AIDS</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HIV/AIDS means Human Immuno not treated, Deficiency Virus infection and</p>
<p>Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS). When we talk of HIV/AIDS we mean a condition caused by infection with the human immuno-deficiency Virus. This Virus is capable of entering every part of the body because it flows with the blood. It is blood born.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>There are three stages of HIV: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li></li>
<li><strong>Clinical latency period of incubation </strong></li>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Infection period</strong> is the time the virus enters the human body through sex, blood transfusion, birth, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Clinical latency </strong>or hidden period of incubation or period of destruction. At this stage the virus attacks the immune system of the body, and if not treated, may result in the destruction of the immune system. Note; immune system is the defence system of the body and if the body becomes defenceless, the body becomes open to disease invasion to all manner of diseases particularly tuberculosis. This stage gives birth to the third stage called AIDS.</li>
<li><strong>AIDS- </strong>At this stage any disease can kill the patient because of low resistance.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h5>Mode of transmission</h5>
<ul>
<li>Blood transfusion</li>
<li>From a mother who is a carrier to the child</li>
<li>Through sexual intercourse</li>
<li>Needle sharing, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Symptom of HIV/AIDS</h5>
<p>They include</p>
<ul>
<li>Illness/fever</li>
<li>Weight loss</li>
<li>Tuberculosis</li>
<li>Headache</li>
<li>Vomiting/diarrhea</li>
<li>Sores of the mouth and genital.</li>
<li>Muscle</li>
</ul>
<h5>Prevention of AIDS</h5>
<h5>The following measures can help prevent the disease:</h5>
<ul>
<li>Avoid indiscriminate sex; stick to your wife</li>
<li>A pregnant who is a carrier must not be allowed breastfeed the baby</li>
<li>A pregnant mother who is a carrier should see doctor for care till the babe is born</li>
<li>Avoid sharing sharp objects, such injection needle, razor blade, nail cutter, and so with people.</li>
<li>Blood must be screened before transfusion takes place.</li>
<li>Practice total abstinence otherwise use condom.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Unit 7</h4>
<h4>Consequences of Contacting diseases on individual, Family and Society</h4>
<h4>The above topic has many societies many consequences.</h4>
<h5>(A) On individual level</h5>
<ul>
<li>He/she is sick always</li>
<li>He/she 1s not happy and cannot participate actively in sports.</li>
<li>Always on his own and alone.</li>
<li>Some parts of the body are lost for example in leprosy.</li>
<li>The person has no savings because he is either in the hospital or buying drugs.</li>
<li>They are usually discriminated against as in the case of leprosy, HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, etc.</li>
<li>The person may not achieve his/her target academically, socially, economically, etc. in life.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>B) At the Family Level</h5>
<p>The consequences include following</p>
<ul>
<li>In the case of HIV/AIDS the family eroded</li>
<li>Economically money to save his/her Ife</li>
<li>It becomes a big loss v person dies</li>
<li>When a sick person is in no person is happy</li>
<li>Resources that would have come from that person to the family lost.</li>
<li>The person is estranged from members of hs family for instance, in the case of leprosy tuberculosis, etc</li>
</ul>
<h5>At the Society level</h5>
<p>The services he would have rendered to the society will be lost. Maybe he would have been a medical Doctor, Barrister, Nurse, Priest, Driver, a Farmer or a top politician.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h4>Unit 8</h4>
<h4>Prevention of Diseases Generally</h4>
<ul>
<li>Environment should be kept clean at all times</li>
<li>Educating the people on the dangers on diseases will help in on small measure to prevent or reduce its occurrence.</li>
<li>Immunization reduces the effect off diseases on the society</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to go for tests before having anything to do with opposite sex or any person at all.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Topic: Isometric Drawing</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>lsometric drawing is a form of pictorial drawing which is usually inclined at 30&deg; to the horizontal plane. It is a clear way of presenting information about the physical out look of objects. The principal distinguishing features of an isometric drawing are the lines on which the drawing is based. These lines are known as isometric axes and are inclined at angles of 120&deg; to one another. There are three isometric axes, one is vertical and the other two are appositively inclined at an angle of 30&deg; to the horizontal plain. These axes, are constructed by the use of a tee square and 60&deg; / 30&deg; set squares. It is the drawing of an object with three dimensions of depth, length and width pictorially.</p>

<h4>Unit 1</h4>
<h4>Characteristics of Isometric Drawings</h4>
<ul>
<li>A true circle or an object will become an ellipse when drawn in isometric view. Likewise, a curve on the object will be slightly distorted in an isometric view.</li>
<li>The length, breadth, and height of straight-edged object are distorted when drawn in isometric views.</li>
<li>Depending on the viewing point, an inclined side of an object may appear distorted when drawn in isometric views</li>
<li>Parallel lines on the object remain parallel when drawn in isometric views.</li>
<li>Like all pictorial drawings, hidden details are normally not shown on isometric drawings,</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note that isometric drawings are different from isometric projections. Whereas an isometric drawing is drawn with an ordinary scale, an isometric projection is drawn with an isometric scale which makes et object look shorter than the real size. In both cases, however, the pictorial value of the object drawn remains the same. <strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

<h4>Unit 2</h4>
<h4>Importance of Isometric Drawing</h4>
<p>Isometric drawing enables students to practice and draw objects to appear as they are.</p>
<ul>
<li>It is a clear way of presenting information about the physical outlook of an object.</li>
<li>It helps designers to put down their ideas before going into detailed description of the object.</li>
<li>It is easily understood by nontechnical personnel than orthographic projection.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Unit 3</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;Examples of Isometric Drawings</h4>
<p>lsometric drawings are based on these regular solids, namely:</p>
<p><strong>A Prism:</strong> A prism is a solid figure with a flat base and parallel upright edges. It is a solid figure with; similar; equal and parallel ends, and with sides which are parallelograms.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Types of Prisms:</strong> The different types of prisms are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Triangular Prism</li>
<li>Rectangular prism</li>
<li>Pentagonal prism</li>
<li>Hexagonal prism</li>
<li>Octagonal prism</li>
<li>Cylindrical prism.</li>
<li>Octagonal Prism</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Pyramid:</strong> A pyramid is a solid figure with a flat base and number.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Cone:</strong> A cone is solid figure, usually a circular based with the parts joining to a point called the vertex outside the plane of the base. Examples of cones are, funnel, pineapple, conical flasks, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Sphere: </strong>A sphere is a round figure in space. It can be formed by rotating a semi-circle about its diameter. The earth in which we live is an example of a sphere. The earth is spherical in shape.</p>

<h4>Unit 4.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;Uses of Isometric Drawings</h4>
<ul>
<li>They promote quick and easy understanding of the shape and size of an object.</li>
<li>They help in the making of quick design and construction of objects.</li>
<li>They give a more realistic impression of the form of an object than by orthographic drawing.</li>
<li>They promote the production of catalogues, leaflets and manuals by artists.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Unit 5</h4>
<h4>Oblique Drawings</h4>
<p>An oblique drawing is one method of pictorial drawing. The slanting sides of an oblique drawing are usually drawn at 45&deg;. One face of an oblique drawing is the true face. The two types of oblique drawings are:</p>
<p>(a) <strong>Cabinet</strong> and (b) <strong>Cavalier</strong>. In a cabinet type of oblique drawing, the slanting sides of an object are drawn half the full size. Generally, the cabinet type is preferred to the cavalier type.</p>

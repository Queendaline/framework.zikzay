2&&&Chapter 2&&&Environmental Hazard1&&&<h2>Topic 2</h2><h3>Environmental Hazards 1</h3><h3>Sub Topic: Environmental Hazard1</h3><h3>2.1. Introduction</h3><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We recall that the environment is the total circumstances surrounding an organism or group of organisms, specifically.</p><ol><li>The combination of extemal physical conditions that affect and influence the growth and development of organisms.</li><li>The complex of social and cultural conditions affecting the nature of an individual or community. Therefore, an environmental hazard is any condition, process state adversely affecting the environment. Environmental hazards are those things which expose the environment to danger, harm or risks.</li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Hazards manifest as physical or chemical pollution in air, water and soils. Environmental hazards can cause wide spread ham to humans and the physical environment. This Theme discusses soil erosion.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h4>Unit 1</h4><h4>Meaning of Soil Erosion</h4><p>Soil erosion is defined as the wearing a way of top soil. Top soil is the top layer of soil and it is the most fertile because it contains the most organic nutrient rich materials. Therefore, this is the layer that farmers want to protect for growing their crops and constructing ranches growing grasses for their cattle to graze on.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h4>Unit 2</h4><h4>&nbsp;Factors Determining Soil Erosion</h4><p>There are various factors determining soil erodibility. The following are the most important ones:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><ol><li><strong>Slope of the land (topography):</strong> The steeper the slope, the greater the erosion as a result of the increased velocity (swiftness) of water flow.</li><li><strong>Soil texture (type of soil):</strong> Soil texture is the &lsquo;size distribution of soil particles. The size particles never change.</li><li><strong>Soil Structure:</strong> Soil structure means the grouping or arrangement of soil particles. Over cultivation and compaction cause the soil to lose the structure and cohesion (ability to stick together) and it erodes more easily.</li><li><strong>Organic Materials:</strong> Organic material is the &ldquo;glue&rdquo; that binds the soil particles together and plays an important role preventing soil erosion. Organic matter is main source of energy for soil organisms both plants and animals. It also influences the infiltrating capacity of the soil thereby, reducing runoff.</li><li><strong>Vegetative cover:</strong> The loss of protective covering through overgrazing, ploughing and fire (activities of man) makes soil vulnerable to being swept away by wind and water.</li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><h5>Types of Water Erosion and Surface Water Runoff</h5><p>One of the main causes of soil erosion is water erosion; which is the loss of topsoil due to water. Raindrops fall directly on topsoil. The impact of the raindrops loosens the material bonding it together, allowing small fragments to detach. If the rainfall continues, water gathers on the ground causing water flow on the lang surface, known as &ldquo;surface water runoff&rsquo;. This runoff carries the detached soil materials away deposits them elsewhere. The materials may be washed down slope of the land and either end up the value or are washed away out to sea by streams and rivers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h5>Forms of water Erosion</h5><ol><li><strong>Sheet Erosion</strong>: Sheet erosion is erosion that occurs fairly evenly over an area. As raindrops loosen the soil the Surface water runoff can transport top soil in a uniform fashion, almost uke a bed sheet sliding off of a bed. This can be so subtle that it might not even be noticed until much of the valuable nutrient-rich topsoil has already been washed away.</li><li><strong>Rill Erosion</strong>: Rill erosion is erosion that results in small, short-lived and well-defined streams. When rainfall does not soak into the soil, it can gather on the surface and runs downhill, forming narrow tracks or small channels of water known as rills through which the water flows carrying soil nutrients along with.</li><li><strong>Gully Erosion</strong>: Gully erosion can be thought of as advanced ill erosion. In fact, if rills are not addressed or checked, they will grow into larger gullies. Therefore, gully erosion occurs when rainfall causes continuous removal of soil particles along a particular course that it results in the cutting of-a narrow ditch. This ditch gradually deepens and widens as water continues to flow along it until gullies are formed.</li><li><strong>Bank </strong><strong>Erosion (Stream Bank Erosion): </strong>Bank erosion is another type of water erosion. Bank erosion is defined as the erosion of the bank of a stream or water ways.</li><li><strong>Wind Erosion:</strong> Of course, water is not only the agent that can cause erosion.</li></ol><p>Wind Erosion Definition: Wind erosion is simply the loss of topsoil due to wind.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h4>Unit 3</h4><h4>Cause of wind erosion:</h4><p>&nbsp;The following are causes of soil erosion.</p><ul><li>Water</li><li>Wind</li><li>Glacier (ice)</li><li></li></ul><h5>Effects of Soil Erosion</h5><p>The following effects may ensue as a result of soil erosion.</p><ul><li>Top soil which is rich in organic matter, fertility and soil life relocated to somewhere else.</li><li>It reduces land productivity, resulting in poor plant yield.</li><li>It may lead to famine in the land and in extreme hunger.</li><li>It contributes to pollution of adjacent water.</li><li>Crop emergence, growth and yield are directly affected by the loss of natural nutrient and applied fertilizer and pesticides.</li><li>Seeds and plants can be easily disturbed or completely removed or buried.</li>
<li>Soil stability, quality and texture can be affected by the loss of soil.</li>

<h4>Unit 5</h4>
<h4>Control /Prevention of Soil Erosions</h4>
<p>There are two major methods of controlling/preventing erosion. Which includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cultural and method.</li>
<li>Construction of barriers.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are further discussed in details:</p>
<h5>Cultural Methods of Controlling Erosions</h5>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cropping and Vegetation</strong>: The Potential for erosion increases if the soil has little or no vegetation cover of plant and or crop residues. Vegetative cover is the covering of piece-of land or soil with vegetation to prevent the direct exposure of the topsoil to water runoffs and wind.</li>
<li><strong>Planting Cover crops like melon and potatoes</strong>. There, are Some crops that provide a bulk Protective cover for a major Portion of the year such as alfalfa or winter cover crop.</li>
<li><strong>Grass</strong> This means allowing the soil to rest under the grass for some time before cultivating it.</li>
<li><strong>Crop rotation which involves planting different </strong>crop on the same piece of land at different times.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li>2<strong>. Application of Compost.</strong> The use of human or animal droppings tend to raise the organic matter content of the soil. Organic miter makes soil easy for water absorption, binds the soil particles together and reduces the rate of runoff.</li>
<li><strong> Avoidance of Bush Burning. </strong>Stop setting the bush on fire This is because fire destroys the ground cover which protects the soil against erosion. It also destroys organic matter, soil organisms and flora which aerate and enrich the soil.</li>
<li>4<strong>. Stop Over-Grazing</strong>: Over grazing expose the topsoil to erosion, and the feet of herdsmen animals harden the top layer of the soil, making it impossible for water permeate into the soil.</li>
<li><strong>Application Fertilizer/Liming the Soil</strong> (inorganic matter): This adds lime to the soil, which binds the soil particles together, form, good crumb structure is difficult to be eroded away.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>The Importance of Plants in Checking Soil Erosion</h5>
<p>As a matter of emphasis, we must try to exploit all our cultural methods of checking erosion especially by using plants for the following reasons.</p>
<ul>
<li>Plants slow down water as to flow over the land (runoff) and allows much of the rain to soak the soil.</li>
<li>Plant roots hold the soil in position and prevent it from being washed away.</li>
<li>Plants break the impact of a raindrop before it hits the soil thus reducing its ability to erode.</li>
<li>Plants in wetlands and on the banks of fivers are of particular importance as they stow down the flow of the water and their roots bind the soil, thus preventing erosion.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Controlling Soil Erosion by Constructions.</h5>
<ol>
<li><strong> Construction of Barriers:</strong> construct rocks or blocks as intervening structure across erosion pathway especially in the case of gully erosion. This will reduce the speed of the runoffs and fill the gully with sand and residual matters.</li>
<li><strong> Planting Trees</strong>: Tall trees can be planted especially in sandy areas as wind breaks. This will reduce the rate of wind erosion. Furthermore, it may be stated here that crop management system that favours contour ploughing, Strip-cropping and terracing techniques can further reduce the amount of erosion in an erosion prone zone.</li>
<li><strong> Terracing: </strong>This involves leveling a hilly area in form of steps so that planting is done on the horizontal portion while the vertical portion acts as a retaining wall. Terracing reduces the speed of water.</li>
<li><strong>construction of contour Bunds: </strong>This is the construction of ridge (also known bunds) across a slope horizontally: These as wash-stops preventing run-offs down the slopes. Water then settles on the ground and deposits suspended residual matters. This makes the runoffs be diverted to other directions along the contour and thereby slowing down the speed of flow.</li>
<li><strong> strip-cropping: </strong>This involves leaving some strips&rdquo; of land uncultivated between cultivated areas. This reduces the rate of runoffs. Often times, tall grasses may be planted along the contour lines to form barrier Strips. This becomes very encouraging in areas where the slope of land is not steep.</li>
<li><strong> Making-Sit Traps:</strong> Stil-traps are made from stakes and woven with bamboo spits These are driven into channels of guilty erosion to control the downward movement of water run-offs.</li>
</ol>
<p>In summary, preventing so erosion can be very involving as it has political, economic and technical implications.</p>

<h4>Unit 6</h4>
<h4>Sub-Topic: Flooding Meaning of Flooding</h4>
<p>Flooding is a weather-related environmental hazard that is widespread around the world. It can occur virtually anywhere. A flood defined as water overflowing onto land that is usually dry. Flooding often thought of as a result of heavy rainfall. However, floods can arise in a number of ways that are not directly related to ongoing weather events Floods can cause disasters to homes farmers, industries, Communities and creating untold hardships for them. For instance, it has forced many people to leave their natural lands and homes and relocate to other places.</p>
<p>In this Unit, we shall learn about drainage patterns, meanings, cause and effects of flood including prevention measures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>&nbsp;Drainage patters</h5>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong></p>
<p>Drainage is the natural or artificial removal of surface and sub-surface water from an area. Many agricultural soils need drainage to improve production or to ensure water supplies. Alliteratively, drainage can also be defined as a system by which water or waste flows away. Drainage systems are the patterns formed by the streams, rivers and lakes in a particular drainage basin. According to the shape of the channels, drainage s&rsquo; stems can Bil into one of several categories known&rdquo; as drainage patterns. Drainage patterns depend on the topography and geology of the natural or man-made (artificial). Natural Drainage Patterns</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Accord to Drainage Pattern</strong>. A drainage system is described as accordant if its pattern correlates to the structure and relief of the landscape over which it flows.</li>
<li><strong>Dendritic Drainage Pattern: </strong>Dendritic: systems are the most common form of drainage system. In this type, many contributing steams join together and flow into the tributaries of the main river near a sloppy area or at oblique angle. It works like a tree with its branches.</li>
</ol>
<p>Dendritic systems form in V-shaped valleys hence the surface rocks must be impervious and non-porous (does not allow water to seep down).</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Parallel Drainage pattern: </strong>Parallel drainage system is a pattern of rivers, caused by steep slopes with same relief. The steep slopes cause the streams to flow swiftly and in a straight line with few tributaries and all low in the same direction. This system forms a uniformity slopping surface. For instance, rivers flowing Fast West or South West uniformly in &lsquo; straight line. Other examples are rivers flowing south east from the Aberdare mountains in Kenya.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Trellis Drainage Pattern</strong>: The geometry of a trellis drainage system is similar to that of a common garden trellis used to grow vines. As the river flows along a strike valley, smaller tributaries feed into it from the steep slopes on the sides of mountains. These tributaries enter the main river at approximately 90&deg; angle, causing a trellis-like appearance of the drainage system. Trellis drainage is characteristic of folded mountains such as the Appalachian Mountains in North America and in the North part of Trinidad.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong>Rectangular Drainage pattern: </strong>Rectangular drainage system develops on rocks that are of union, resistance to erosion, but which have two directions of joining at approximately right angles. The joints are usually less resistant to erosion than the bulk rock; so, erosion tends to preferentially open-the joints and streams eventually develop along the joints. This results in a stream system in which streams consisting mainly of straight-line segments with right angles bends and tributaries join larger streams at right angles.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Radial drainage pattern: </strong>In radial drainage system, the streams radiate outward from a central high point. Volcanoes usually display excellent radial drainage pattern.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Deranged drainage pattern: </strong>This is a drainage system in drainage basins where there is no coherent pattern to the rivers and lakes. It happens in areas where there has been much geological disruptions. A good example is the Canadian shield.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Annular Drainage pattern/Reticulate Pattern:</strong> In an annular drainage pattern, steams follow a roughly circular concentrated path along a belt of weak rock in a ring like pattern.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Unit 7</h4>
<h4>Man-Made or Artificial Drainage System</h4>
<p>Man-made drainage systems depend a number of factors. These factors include topography (structure), climate and vegetation cover of the level. Artificial drainage system could be divided into two:</p>
<ul>
<li>Surface drainage system</li>
<li>Underground drainage system.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h5>Meaning of Flood and Flooding</h5>
<p>Floods generally develop over a Period of time when there is too much rainfall to fit in the rivers, streams, Oceans, seas, dans, gutter or drainages and consequently water spreads over the land including farmlands, market places as well as buildings. This results in loss of lives and property. This is known as flood. Therefore, flood is defined as an over-flow of much volume of water which covers the land. Flooding, itself is a phenomenon in which an area of land temporarily submerged by. Could last for some days or weeks before the flood dries or recedes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Unit 8</h4>
<h4>Types of flood</h4>
<p>There are three common types of flood. These are:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Coastal (Surge flood)</strong>: Coastal flood as the name suggests occurs in areas that lie in the coast of Sea, Ocean, or other large bodies open water. It is typically the result of extreme tidal conditions caused by Severe weather, such as hurricanes and other storms.</li>
<li><strong>Fluvial (River flood)</strong>: Fluvial or riverine flooding occurs when excessive rainfall over an extended period of time cause a river to exceed its capacity. It can also be caused by heavy snow melt and ice jams. The damage from a river flood can be widespread as the overflow affects smaller downstream often causing dams and dikes to break and swamp nearby areas.</li>
<li><strong>Fluvial (Surface flood):</strong> A fluvial or surface flood is caused when heavy rainfall creates a flood event independent of an over flowing water</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Unit 9</h4>
<h4>Causes of flood&nbsp;</h4>
<p>Flooding occurs most commonly from heavy rainfall when natural watercourses do not have capacity to convey excess water. But note that the floods are not always caused by: heavy rainfall. They can result from other phenomenon particularly coastal areas, such as storm surge associated with a tropical cyclone, a tsunami or a high tide. Sometimes, earthquake could cause dams to break which may result in flooding of the downstream areas. Other factors which may contribute to flooding include;</p>
<ul>
<li>Volume, Spatial distribution, intensity and duration of rainfall) over a catchment capacity of the watercourse or stream network to convey runoff.</li>
<li>Catchment and weather conditions prior to a rainfall event.</li>
<li>Ground cover.</li>
<li></li>
<li>Tidal influences</li>
<li>Blockage of drainage system can result to an over-flow of water after a heavy rainfall.</li>
<li>Poor outlay of the city without good drainage system by urban planners.</li>
<li>When streams, rivers and dams are filled to the brim, any additional rainfall will cause the bank to overflow and flooding occurs. Prolonged drought can cause flooding due to sudden heavy rainfall after several years; producing torrential down pour which results in loss of lives and property.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h4>Unit 10</h4>
<h4>Community and Farmland</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Floodwater can seriously disrupt public and personal transport by cutting off roads and railway lines, as well as communication links when telephone lines are damaged.</li>
<li>Floods disrupt normal drainage systems in cities, and sewage spill are usually very common which portend a serious health hazard. Bacteria, mould, viruses and pathogens (diseases causing microorganism) cause &ndash; diseases which trigger allergic reactions and continue to damage materials long after a flood.</li>
<li>Adults, children and livestock may get drowned in the flood.</li>
<li>Flood can contaminate natural water supplies, leading to scarcity of drinking water. This happens when floods flow into streams used for drinking.</li>
<li>Agricultural produce may be lost due to flood resulting in to food shortage and high cost of living.</li>
<li>Some plants that cannot tolerate too much water environment may be choked up and die.</li>
<li>Trees may be pulled down and this will lead to deforestation.</li>
<li>Economic hardship may ensue due homes/businesses and Cost of rebuilding damaged and personal property, but the water Submerged property, dearth of food behind causes further damage and high cost of living, books, furniture, photographs and electronic equipment damaged and so on.</li>
<li>People may be displaced from their release of toxic materials from homes and offices and this may force the displaced people to in open fields in schools as refugees where the government can come to their aid through food supplies, clothing and sleeping materials. In 2013, we had the case of internally displaced people (IDP).</li>
<li>Flood can distribute large amounts of water sediments over vast areas, restocking valuables nutrients to agricultural land.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h4>Unit 11</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;Prevention of Flooding</h4>
<p>Meteorologists and environmental agencies aim at protecting people and their property from flooding, helping organizations like the police to give warnings of possible floods so that people can make arrangements or move out of the area if it is dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>The flowing prevention measures could be made: </strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Construction of levees along the riverbanks. A levee is a high-rise wall built to stop a fiver from overflowing its banks and causing flooding.</li>
<li>Placing large rocks on riverbanks or gully and prevent erosion which may lead to serious flooding.</li>
<li>By placing sand bags along riverbanks, gully, gutter drainage can serve as levee to check flooding.</li>
<li>Wetlands should be protected. These are helpful in maintaining a natural drainage system as excess water may accumulate in them.</li>
<li>By creating floodplains and winding streams whereby a special route for drainage of water is made. This prevents the accumulation of water and thereby controlling flooding.</li>
<li>By adopting improved farming methods and afforestation; soil water permeation may be improved.</li>
</ol>

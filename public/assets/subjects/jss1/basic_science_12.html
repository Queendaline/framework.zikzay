<h3>Topic: Radioactivity Introduction</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 1896, a French scientist called Henry Becquerel, discovered that the element Uranium emitted radiations which blackened a photographic plate and like x-rays, could penetrate through paper and similar opaque &lsquo;materials. The radiation was spontaneous and was being emitted all the time, apparently without anything causing it. These radiations are alpha particle, beta-particle and gamma radiation.</p>

<h4><strong>Unit 1 </strong></h4>
<h4><strong>Radioactive Elements </strong></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These are those substances that spontaneously emit particles and radiations from their nucleus as a result of the instability of the nuclei of the atom. Example; radium, radon, polonium and Uranium.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Radioactivity</h4>
<h4>Meaning of Radioactivity</h4>
<p>Radioactivity is the spontaneous decay or disintegration. of unstable nuclei of the atom of an element by the emission of alpha-particle (ùõÇ), beta particle () and gamma (y) radiation with the production of energy (or heat). Radioactivity is also defined as the disintegration/decay of an unstable nucleus with the emission of radiation</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>like ùõÇ, &nbsp;and y and release of energy/ heat. Radioactivity is a spontaneous process. It is independent of external control, and not affected by temperature or pressure. But these changes that occur in the nucleus do not affect the nucleus of the atom. The instrument used in detecting the ùõÇ, , and y is called the Geiger Muller (GM)</p>

<h4>Unit 3</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;Types of Radioactivity</h4>
<p>&nbsp;There are basically two types of radioactivity.</p>
<ol>
<li>Natural radioactivity</li>
<li>Artificial radioactivity</li>
<li><strong>Natural Radioactivity</strong>: This is the spontaneous disintegration of an unstable nuclei with the emission of alpha-particle, beta-particle and gamma radiation or a combination of any two or all of the three with the release of energy/heat.</li>
<li>2<strong>. Artificial Radioactivity:</strong> Artificial radioactivity is defined as a process whereby an ordinary material not normal radioactive is made radioactive by bombarding it with a fast-moving particle. Artificial radioactivity is equally the disintegration of stable nucleus which emits (ùõÇ, ùõÉ, and Y) and release of energy as a resulting of its bombardment with fast moving particle.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Unit 4</h4>
<h4>Uses of Radioactivity.</h4>
<p>They include the following</p>
<ol>
<li>Radioactive dating: for determining the age of rock or the time when an animal died.</li>
<li>Radiotherapy: Radioactive sources are used in diagnosing and treatment of diseases.</li>
<li>It can be used in sterilizing medical instrument in clinics and hospitals.</li>
<li>Used in agriculture as radioactive tracers and preservatives.</li>
<li>Used in generation of nuclear power energy</li>
<li>Used in production of nuclear weapons</li>
<li>Used in metal industries to detect flaws in materials.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Unit 5</h4>
<h4>Dangers of Radioactive Rays</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Radioactive sources can be dangerous to the body if one is exposed to the radiation for a long time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Cells in tissue of the body can be destroyed</li>
<li>Radioactive elements can contaminate water and air</li>
<li>Radioactive elements can upset the normal chemical reaction of the body</li>
<li>Radioactive elements can cause damage to the bone marrows and also affect the blood</li>
<li>Overexposure to radioactive radiation can cause death.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Unit 6</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;Safety Precautions Against Radiation Hazards</h4>
<ul>
<li>Wearing of lead coat</li>
<li>Use of dosimeter gadget/film badges</li>
<li>Putting on warning signs</li>
</ul>

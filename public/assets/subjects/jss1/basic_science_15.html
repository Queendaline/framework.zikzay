<h4>Key Concepts in Timber Processing</h4>
<p>Wood is obtained from Trees. Dead trees are called wood. When wood has not been processed for use, it is typically referred to as Timber. The most important things about trees is that we do not only use them for our furniture and house construction but they provide us with the most important element in life. While the use carbon dioxide which we exhaust to manufacture their food, they give off oxygen which we need to live. So, it is important to have trees in our surroundings.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Growth of Timber: </strong>A tree grows by obtaining its food in the form of sap from the soil by suction through its roots. The sap contains moisture and minerals such as phosphate and nitrates. The sap is transported through the stem to the branches and leaves of a tree. The sap loses moisture through the leaves, absorbs carbon dioxide from the atmosphere by the process d photosynthesis, and becomes heaver. The dense sap later descends and gets deposited under the bark in the form of a thin layer known as cambium. The cambium hardens with, time and adds a new annual ring to that section of the stem. Annual rings show the number of years growth has occurred in a tree.</li>
</ol>
<p>Trees grow in two directions, vertical and horizontal. Vertical growth occurs near the tips of the shoot and root of the plant. Vertical growth starts at germination and continues throughout the life of the plant. it is known as primary growth, while horizon growth is called secondary grow Horizontal growth occurs mostly in the cambium. The cambium layer is in thin walled cells somewhere beneath the outer layer or skin of the young plant. The cambium divides to form plant two new layers of cells; wood cells on the inside, and bark cells on the outside of the cambium<strong>.</strong></p>

<li><strong>Felling of Timber: </strong>Cutting down a tree is referred to as felling of timber. Timber is usually felled for one form of engineering work or the other. For timber to serve a useful purpose as an engineering material, certain factors need to be considered.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Age of the timber:</strong> Timber should be felled only if it mature. This is because under-mature has a large quantity of unused sap, while over-mature timber could develop a number of defects in the wood which is the inner part of tree. Defect reduce the quality of the timber.</li>
<li><strong>Season the year: </strong>Should be felled during the dry season. This is because, in the dry season, the wood sap is reduced and is least active. Again, during the dry season the forest ground is firmer, and timber excavation from the forest.</li>
<li><strong>Method of felling:</strong> Before timber is felled, the direction to which it will fall is determined. The stem is then cut, as near as possible to the ground to avoid waste. Chain saws are usually used in felling trees. A rope may be tied to the tree to pull it to whichever direction you want the tree to fall Only experienced persons should handle the task of timber felling to avoid an accident.</li>
<li><strong>Conversion of Timber:</strong> Conversion is the process of cutting and sawing timber into commercial sizes. The tree trunk or stem is first cut into transportable sizes called logs. At the sawmill the log is converted (cut) into commercial (marketable) sizes such as boards and planks. The popular methods of conversion are plain-sawn and quarter ~ sawn.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>P<strong>lain-Sawn Method: </strong>In this method, the log is sawn plank after plank, without paying attention to the rays. The method is simple, quick and cheap. Hence, many prefer it.</li>
<li>b<strong>. Quarter-Sawn Timber:</strong> This method involves converting the log into planks by cutting along the rays of the wood. The quarter-sawn method needs more attention than the plain-sawn method because the log has to be turned to align with the rays. The planks produced by this method have five figures. The converted timber is then stacked in the timber shed. Timber conversion should normally be done by experienced persons. Wastage of timber should be minimized and adequate allowance should be made for squaring, planning and, shrinkage when fixing the positions of the saw.</li>
<li><strong>Seasoning of Timber:</strong> The process of reducing moisture or drying water content in timber is called seasoning. Freshly felled timber has a large amount of moisture or water content in the form of sap which makes it heavy. Such wet wood possesses low strength and cannot be used for any engineering work. Two methods of seasoning timber are natural or air seasoning and artificial seasoning.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><strong> Natural or Air Seasoning Method</strong> involves stacking planks one on top of the other with pieces of wood called stackers used to separate them. This stacking arrangement ensures that sufficient space is left around each Sawn piece and this allows for free Circulation of air. If need be, a heavy load is placed on the plank to prevent whipping (twisting). The stacked Quarter Sawn planks can either be in the open air or under a roof. Air drying takes several months. It is slow but simple and cheap.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><strong> Artificial Seasoning:</strong> This involves drying the wet timber through other means apart from natural air, Artificial seasoning can be done in the following ways; Water seasoning, boiling seasoning, Salt seasoning, kiln seasoning and electrical seasoning. Wood is usually seasoned artificially in order to reduce the length of time required for natural seasoning. It takes just few weeks to dry wood artificially, but it is more expensive. It demands closer supervision and reduces its strength.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h5>Reasons for seasoning or drying</h5>
<p>Timber is seasoned or dried for the following reasons;</p>
<ul>
<li>It makes wood lighter in weight and therefore easier to transport.</li>
<li>makes the wood stable for engineering work.</li>
<li>It makes wood stronger.</li>
<li>Seasoning makes wood durable because insects and fungi usually attack the starch in the wet sap wood.</li>
<li>It makes wood preservatives more easily.</li>
<li>It enables wood to be well polished.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h4>Unit 2</h4>
<h4>Properties of Good Timber Preservative</h4>
<p>The following characteristics are desired in a good wood preservative.</p>
<ul>
<li>It must be able to remain in the wood for a very long period after it has been applied.</li>
<li>It must be capable of rendering the wood completely poisonous to destructive organisms which feed on wood.</li>
<li>it must not have any odour.</li>
<li>In normal use, it should be incapable of inflicting injury on human beings, domestic animals or pets.</li>
<li>It should be able to maintain its chemical composition for a long period.</li>
<li>It is also desirable that a wood preservative be capable of good penetration into the wood,</li>
<li>It should be capable of being simple and easily applied on wood.</li>
<li>A good preservative should not have a damaging effect on the timber and be able to keep off fungi, insects and termites.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Common Timber Defects</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A defect is anything present in wood, which results in the lowering of its quality or value. It can be natural or artificial.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Natural Defects:</strong> Natural Defects are those, which occur in the growing tree and are usually manifested only after it has been felled. Some natural defects are;</li>
<li><strong>Heart Shake:</strong> This is a split across the centre of a log, usually along a medullary ray.</li>
<li><strong>Star Shake:</strong> This is different from the heart shake only by the fact that there are several splits, each along a medullary ray.</li>
<li><strong>Cup Shake: </strong>This is a discontinuous split between two growth rings.</li>
<li><strong>Ring Shake: </strong>A circular crack, which completely separated two annual rings.</li>
<li><strong>Knot:</strong> This is a portion of a branch enclosed inside the stem of a tree.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Artificial Defects: </strong>Artificial defects are those, which are caused by organisms or situations which are external to the growing tree or felled timber. These include;</li>
<li><strong>Cup:</strong> This is a bend across the face of a plank.</li>
<li><strong>Bow:</strong> This is a bend along the length of a plank.</li>
<li><strong>Twist or Warp:</strong> This is a multiple bend about the axis of a plank.</li>
<li><strong>Check:</strong> A split along the grain of wood.</li>
<li><strong>Waney edge:</strong> This is the bark of tree showing on the edge of a Plank.</li>
<li><strong>Dry root: </strong>This result when tiny organisms known as fungi destroy the wood.</li>
<li><strong>Fungus Stain:</strong> Stain occurring on &gt; wood as a result of fungus attack.</li>
<li><strong>Insect Attack:</strong> This result when termites and other insects live in the wood and steadily destroy it</li>
</ol>
<p>Defects listed in numbers (i-iv) above are usually Caused by bad seasoning practices.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Shrinkage in -Timber:</strong> Seasoning causes timber to shrink.</li>
</ol>
<p>Some shrinkage occurs along the Circumference and this causes the growth rings to shorten. This is called <strong>circumferential shrinkage</strong>. Shrinkage also occurs longitudinally along the grain of wood thus shortening the length of the log. This is known as <strong>longitudinal shrinkage</strong>. Radial shrinkage also occurs from the bark towards the centre of the trunk. In terms of extent, usually the longitudinal shrinkage is the least while the circumferential shrinkage is the largest.</p>

<h4>Unit 4</h4>
<h4>Treatment and Timber Preservation Methods</h4>
<p>Any special care or treatment given to wood or timber -amounts to its preservation. Because the sapwood of tees contains water food salts, air and warmth, wood is often attacked by fungi, termites, insects and other pestiferous organisms: Since usually contain varying amounts of these substances, the rate of attack differs with Wood type. This attack lowers the quality of wood and consequently reduces its service life. In order to preserve the service of life of wood, there is therefore a need to protect wood against an attack. Unlikely, this is done through any suitable method of wood perseveration. Wood preservation is the process of applying certain substances like chemicals to wood in order to protect it against attack by destructive organisms. like fungi, termites, insects etc, and therefore prolong its service life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Preservation Methods:</strong> A substance which is applied to wood in order to prevent its deterioration and hence lengthen its service life is called a <strong>wood preservative</strong>. A wood preservative works essentially by making the food material in wood poisonous to the destructive agents.</p>
<p>The three principal methods are:</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;Solvent Chemicals:</strong> The solvent type of chemicals need to be dissolved in liquids other than water so as to form solutions which then be applied on wood.</p>
<p><strong>Water-bome Chemicals: </strong>The water-borne chemicals are dissolved in water to form the required solutions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>Tar Oils: </strong>A common example of tar oil is creosote; creosote is black and its often used to paint wooden electric and telephone poles.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h4>Unit 5</h4>
<h4>Importance of Timber Treatment</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The importance of timber treatment among others includes:</p>
<ol>
<li>It will prolong the service life of the timber or wood.</li>
<li>It will make the timber to withstand or resist the destructive effects of fungi, bacteria, insects and termites attack an. timber.</li>
<li>Timber treatment will position the timber to absorb paint, polish or any other chemicals that will enhance its. commercial value.</li>

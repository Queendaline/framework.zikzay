<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The game Is played on a rectangular field that measures 90m long and 54m wide. The length is called the sideline while the width is called the goal line. The centre line cuts the field (widthway) into two equal halves, these two halves are further divided into two equal parts by the 22 5m lines giving rise to four equal parts of the field 225m. Two goal posts at the middle of the goal lines are constructed. There is also the sinking circle constructed from each of the upright posts of the goal mouth using a radius of 14. 67m.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The striking circle is very important in several ways in the game of field hockey They include.</p>

<h4>Meaning of Rotary Motion&nbsp;</h4>
<p>When a body moves in such a way that all the points on it, spin about a fixed axis, its motion is described as rotary. In other words, rotary is a motion about a fixed centre of rotation largely used in machines and engines. In rotary motion, the particles of the body move along concentric paths. However, the body itself does not alter its location. Another name by which rotary motion is known is rotational motion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>There are different types of rotary motion. Some of these are following:</h5>
<ol>
<li><strong>One-way motion: </strong>one-way rotation is characterized by the spinning continuously in one direction. Examples of these are the crank shaft of a running engine, the shaft of ap electric motor, the armature winding of an electric generator, so on.</li>
<li><strong>Reversible Rotary Motion</strong>: <strong>A</strong>nother type of rotary motion is the reversible rotary motion. In this case, the clockwise movement of the rotating shaft is immediately followed by an anti-clockwise movement. This process may be continuous as in the case of a motor vehicle windscreen wiper or intermittent as in the case of a door handle. The rotating handle by which a vehicle window is controlled is also an example of an object which undergoes a reversible rotary motion.</li>
<li><strong>One</strong>-<strong>way intermittent Rotary Motion: </strong>The third type is the one-way intermittent rotary motion. In this case, the rotation is interrupted at specific time intervals.</li>
</ol>
<p>An example of this is the second is indicator on an analogy watch or clock. The indicator rotates but stops for slight seconds along its path.</p>
<p>The non-return rotary motion is employed in racket mechanisms found on workshop tools, vehicle handbrakes etc. This type of rotary motion is characterized by the object being locked in position so that an oppositely directed motion is impossible. Brake pedals, door knobs, throttles, cork screws, kitchen tin cutters, control knobs on electric gadgets, wheels, etc are other examples of objects in which rotation is beneficially applied.</p>

<li><strong>Load drum of a cane</strong>: A crane is used for lifting or lowering heavy loads as may be required. The crane is designed to make use of lifting rope. Arrangements are made to wine the rope on a drum for lifting and unwinding it to lower the load. That is, the drum can rote in either clockwise or anti-clockwise direction. Devices are provided on the crane to facilitate staring or stopping the drum whenever it&rsquo;s necessary.</li>
<li><strong>Brakes</strong>: The primary function of brakes is to control motion. First, by slowing down the motion and bringing the motion to a stop if necessary. There are many types of brakes in use brakes, but we shall discuss motor car brakes. The effective friction to stop the car is obtained by pressing stationery shoes or pads against its rotating member. Hydraulic system is common employed for this purpose. This involves pressurizing brake fluid to operate the pad in disc brakes and shoes.</li>
<li>Operation of the brakes is initiated from the driver by pressing the brake pedal which operates the hydraulic system. For the rotating drum brakes, as the shoes which press against the drum are actuated by the wheel cylinders when the pedal is operated. As soon as the pedal is depressed, the shoes are returned to their original position by the springs and the road wheels are released. For this disc brakes, when the driver operates the brake pedal, the pads will grip the disc by the action of the pistons fixed rate behind the pads. The brakes are released as soon as the brake pedal is g depressed.</li>
<li><strong>Clutches: </strong>Power transmission, it is often necessary to be able to interrupt the driver without reducing the speed of the prime mover. For example, when changing motor car, the engine does not have to be stopped nor do we have to stop the machine when examining a work piece on the lathe. The function of a clutch is to interrupt the motion from one shaft to another in power transmission line. There are many types of clutches; a dog clutch and a friction clutch. We shall discuss about friction clutches which are used in motor cars. The dog clutch is not suitable for cars because the connection of a rotating engine to a stationery transmission shall will not only damage the transmission but also jolt the car violently.</li>
<li>The friction clutch takes up the drive smoothly and also disengages the drive when required.</li>
<li>Disc is connected to the engine while disc b" is connected to the transmission. When the discs are in motor cars. The dog clutch is not separated, no drive is affected.1 suitable for motor car because the soon as the discs are in contact, the connection of a rotating engine to transmission line. The application jolt the car violently. The friction force controls the drive and this can be varied accordingly to obtain a smooth take-off.</li>
<li><strong>Ratchets: </strong>A ratchet is a set of teeth arranged at the edge of a bar or name wheel with pawl to ensure motion usually in one direction only. It mainly used for intermittent motion.</li>

<h4>Principle of Application</h4>
<p>There are two principle types motion namely: Linear Motion and Rotary Motion. Generally, motion is governed by certain physical laws called Newton's Law of motion. There are three of such laws.</p>
<p><strong>Newton's first law:</strong> The first states that a body which is at rest or moving at a constant velocity will continue to remain at rest or move at its constant velocity unless it is acted upon by a force, in which case it will act otherwise. This law is otherwise known as the law of <strong>INERTIA</strong>. Inertia is the property of matter, which makes it to maintain an in changing state of rest, or state the motion Inertia depends on the mass of object. The larger the mass, the larger in the inertia. This means that it will be easier to change the velocity of a light object that of a heavy object. A passenger standing inside a bus is an -example of the application of newton&rsquo;s first law of motion. Wherever the bus starts moving or accelerates suddenly, the passenger fall backward, in trying to remain at rest. If however the bus stops moving or decelerates suddenly, the passenger fails forward in trying to continue moving.</p>
<p><strong>Newton&rsquo;s Second Law:</strong> Newton's Second law states that the force coming motion on a body is directly proportion d to the mas and acceleration of the body for a Constant mass a large force will result in a larger acceleration. For a Constant force, the larger the mass, the smaller the acceleration. An application of the second law is that the effect of a force is always in the direction of the force. for example, if you punch an ae away from you, assuming no other forces are involved, they should move away from you.</p>
<p><strong>Newton&rsquo;s Third Law:</strong> The third law states that when one body exerts a force or another body, this other body also exerts an equal by oppositely directed force on the first body. This implies that reaction Is always equal and opposite to action. The third law has many practical applications. Some of these are the balloon, rocket engine, and jet engine. In each case, air or gas rushing out 'of nozzles causes a reaction which punches the object in an opposite direction. An application of the third law is that of a raffle, which recoils after a bullet is fired.</p>

<h4>Conversion of Rotary Motion to Linear Motion.</h4>
<p>The electric motor and the internal combustion engine (IC) are the two most important deices for producing motion. However, the kind of motion produced by these two devices is rotary motion is quite useful but there are instances when linear motion is desired. Because of this a number of mechanisms through which rotary motion is converted into linear motion have been invented. Some of these mechanisms are rack and pinion, screws, crank and piston, cams and eccentrics. through the appropriate combination of one or more of these mechanisms, various types of machine tools are able to convert rotary motion produced by the electric motors into useful linear motion. A number of these mechanisms have been taught earlier in this course. Currently, we are considering them within the context of changing a type of motion to another.</p>

<li><strong>Rack and Pinion:</strong> A rack and pinion consists of a flat bar called rack in contact with a wheel called pinion. Both of them have teeth which are designed to mesh with themselves. When used, it is the pinion that is attached to the power source, such as the shaft of a motor or internal combustion. As the pinion rotates, its teeth put those of thee rack. The result is that the rack moves linearly. In some manual machines, the pinion is driven by means of a handle attached to it. An example of this is the work table of a drilling machine, which is raised or lowered through a rack and pinion mechanism. %%%%065%%%%<strong>Fig 11.1 Rack and pinion</strong></li>

<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Screw:</strong> A screw usually takes the form of a round rod having a spinal thread along its outer surface. It has a specially shaped head by which it is driven through the use of an appropriate screw driver. When being fastened or fastened, the screw rotates about its axis and by so doing moves linearly along the same axis. The anger bit and drilling bit also operate on the basic working principle of screws.</li>
</ol>

<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Crank and Slider:</strong> The Crank and Sider Consists of a rotating disk or plate called crank connected by a rod to a linearly moving block called slider. As the crank rotates, the slider is moved forward and backward within a slot or other suitable constraint. %%%%067%%%%<strong>Fig 11.2 Screw</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Crank, Connecting Rod, and Piston:</strong> This is an application of the crank and slider. It is used in internal combustion engine. In this case, the crank takes the form of a crankshaft and the piston represents the slider. The connecting rod is attached to the crankshaft at one end and the piston at the other. The piston moves within a cylinder which stands for the constraint along which a slider moves. Depending on the kind of engine, there may be four or six cylinders.</li>
</ol>
<p>In an internal combustion (IC) engine cylinder, it is linear motion which is converted to rotary motion and not the reverse. Expanding gases produced by the combustion of fuel and air in the cylinder push the pistons up down continuously. This linear motion is transmitted to the crankshaft, which consequently rotates. In a motor car, the rotary motion, of the crankshaft is passed on to the transmission System which is ultimately connected to the wheels.%%%%069%%%% <strong>Fig 11.3 crank and slider</strong></p>

<ol start="5">
<li><strong>Cam:</strong> A Cam is a device so shaped that it is round on one side and oblong on the other side. One common use of cams is the opening and closing of valves. In such an instance, a valve cover is held against the cam by means of a spring. As the cam rotates, the valve cover is pushed forward and backwards repeatedly. A cam may be used singly or used in combination as is the case with the camshaft of 1.C engines. %%%%071%%%%<strong>Fig 11.4 A crank and pinion</strong></li>
<li><strong>Eccentrics: </strong>Eccentrics are devices having peculiar shapes needed to transmit motion in some desirable manner. In a true sense, an eccentric object consists of various, shapes combined. An eccentric normally is connected to a source of motion. As the eccentric moves, &amp; pushes against another machine component. The uneven shape of the: eccentric causes the machine component to move in an irregular manner.</li>

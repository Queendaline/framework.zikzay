Again, puberty in girls occurs before that of the boys. Usually, Puberty in girls occurs between the ages 10 years to 14 years while that of the boys occurs between 12 years to 16 years.

In assertiveness, one considers the rights and privileges of the other person and by so doing, finds a balance. It is not always easy to identify assertive behavior. This is because there is a thin line between assertiveness and aggressiveness. Assertive people act to always achieve fair play and resist intimidation. When one treats others with fairness and respect, he or she gets that same treatment in return and people would want to work with him/her. It is unfortunate in our society today very few people are assertive.</p>

<h4>Unit 5 Communication Skill</h4>
<p>Communication simply put, is the process by which people exchange information or express their thoughts, ideas and feelings. Communication is Vital in every aspect of life, be it in the home, church, organization, gymnasium classroom, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Any organization or system where communication skill lacking will always be in chaos. However, for communication to be effective, it is important to master the skills. It has been observed that most people particularly the young ones cannot communicate assertively without being aggressive. And as leaders of tomorrow it is pertinent that you learn to win the hearts of your listeners when addressing them. Assertive communication technique is essential. To convey basic assertions, it is good to use &ldquo;! want&rdquo;, &ldquo;I need&rdquo; or &ldquo;I feel&rsquo;. For example, Jane would rather suggest you keep this pregnancy to avoid exposing you to danger.</p>
<p>If Jane insists, do not flay up rather change your verb. Jane, my daughter, have you forgotten that disobedience is not allowed in our family. Won't you listen to your father? at another aspect of assertive communication: Prepare ahead of time the message you want to convey. I cannot take on any more projects right now.</p>
<p>During the conversation, keep restating your message using the same language over and over again. Don&rsquo;t relent. Eventually, the person is likely to realize that you mean what you are saying.&nbsp;</p>

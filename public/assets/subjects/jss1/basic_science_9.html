<h3>Sound Waves</h3>
<p>Sound is a form of wave motion which is conveyed through an elastic medium from a vibrating body to a listener.</p>
<p>The study of sound waves is important because sound is made use of in our everyday activities. Example; the ringing of the alarm-clock and the whistle of the referee. We can make sound in many ways: by shouting, clapping our hands or banging a table or blowing a whistle, in each of these, something is made to vibrate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Unit 1</h4>
<h4>Production of Sound Waves</h4>
<p>When an object vibrates, it disturbs the surrounding air causing waves to travel outwards in all directions. The disturbance travels out from the source of vibration in the form of longitudinal waves. Sound waves cannot travel through vacuum, a material medium is always required for the passage of sound. Such medium includes solid, liquid and gas. Sound can be produced by plucking the string of guitar, playing musical instruments, rubbing, blowing of whistles, shaking different objects, when a group of soldiers are marching during parade, sound is equally produced. This shows that&rsquo; vibrating objects produce sounds. Vibration is a rapid to-and-fro motion of an object. Example; human voice produces sound due to vibrations in the vocal cords.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: there are sounds that cannot be heard by man, they can be heard by animals like snakes, bats. those sounds are called infrasonic sounds. Their frequencies are below 20Hz. &ndash; Some sounds are within human hearing range of frequencies between &lsquo;4000Hz &mdash; 20,000HZz, they are called <strong>limit of audibility</strong> and they vary from person to person. While some sounds have frequency range above 20,000HZ, those ones are called <strong>ultrasonic sounds.</strong> Ultrasonic sounds are dangerous to the ear as they can cause deafness.</p>
<h5>Uses of sounds</h5>
<ul>
<li>Destroying bacteria in water</li>
<li>Clearing smoke in the air</li>
<li>drying papers</li>
<li>used in cleaning metals</li>
</ul>

<h5>Sources of sounds</h5>
<ol>
<li><strong>Soldiers marching during parade</strong></li>
<li><strong>Vibrating Tuning Fork: </strong>The tuning fork has two steel prongs which Speed of Sound vibrate when struck with a hard rubber, giving some sounds</li>
<li><strong>Musical Instrument:</strong> This musical instrument is of three types.</li>
<li><strong>Wind Instrument:</strong> They produce sound through a vibrating column of air, example; flutes, trumpets, saxophones etc.</li>
<li><strong>Stringed instruments:</strong> Example; Guitar, sonometer, piano, violin, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Percussion instrument:</strong> A percussion instrument produces sound when it is hit or struck, they have taut skin membranes, rods or plates which vibrate when struck. The sound produced is usually of short duration. Examples; talking drums, bells, gongs, xylophone, and soon.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>sound as a form of energy can be transformed into other forms of energy -obeying the law of conservation of energy; which States that in an open or closed system energy can be transformed from one form to another but the total energy of, the system remains the same. Example the telephone receiver changes electrical impulses into sound after converting it to mechanical energy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Factors affecting the speed of sound.</h5>
<p><strong>Temperature: </strong>Speed of sound is directly proportional to the square root of absolute temperature. Hence, the higher the temperature, the higher the speed of sound. This is why sound travels faster in a sunny day than in a colder day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Wind: </strong>The speed of sound increases, if sound travels in the same direction as the wind and decreases if sound travels in the opposite direction. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Density of the Medium</strong>: speed of sound is inversely proportional to the square root of the density. Hence, the higher the density, the lesser the speed of sound. Pressure, pitch and loudness have no effect on the speed of sound.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Unit 4</h4>
<h4>Reflection of Sound</h4>
<p>Like other waves, sound wave can be reflected. When sound wave strikes a smooth surface, the sound will be thrown back, so that one hears the sound a second time.</p>
<p><strong>Echo: </strong>A sound heard after the reflection of sound waves from a plane surface is called an echo. That is, an echo is the reflection of sound wave heard when it meets an obstacle or a barrier.</p>
<h4>Unit 5</h4>
<h4>Uses of Echo The determination of speed of sound in air.</h4>
<ul>
<li>The determination of speed of sound</li>
<li>The determination of the depth of sea bed.</li>
<li>Used in oil and gas exploration.</li>
<li>In locating shoal of fish.</li>
<li>Used in detecting flaws in metal casting.</li>
<li>In medical ultrasound, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Unit 6</h4>
<h4>Hearing</h4>
<p>&nbsp;Hearing is defined as a sense concerned with the perception of sound. Human ear is the sense organ that responds to the stimulus of sound, that is, it allows us to hear sound produced around us. The human ear is typically described as consisting of three parts;</p>
<ul>
<li>The outer flap or external part</li>
<li>The middle part, and</li>
<li>The inner part.</li>
</ul>
<p>The ear plays an important role in the process of delivering sounds to the brain. It is only the mechanism to transmit the sound. It is in the brain where the sounds are actually heard and given meaning. %%%%027%%%% <strong>Fig 9.1 The Ear</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>The Outer Ear:</em></strong> This consists of the pinna (the structure on the side of the head), the ear canal and the tympanic membrane (ear drum). The pinna and the ear canal&rsquo;s function, is to collect, localize and enhance sounds. The ear canal also serves protect the eardrum from foreign bodies.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Middle Ear</em></strong><em>:</em> the middle ear is an air-filled space located behind the eardrum. Attached to the eardrum is the first of three small bones (ossicles) commonly referred to as the hammer, anvil and stirrup. When the sound wave collected by the pinna and enhanced as they travel down the ear Canal strike the ear drum, the ossicles are set into motion. Here the acoustic energy from the sound has now been converted to mechanical energy.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Inner Ear:</em></strong> The inner part of the ear is a fluid filled space comprising of the cochlea, semi-circular canals and other structures. The cochlea houses the sensory organ of hearing. The semi-circular canals and other Structures house the sensory organ for balance. The stirrup bone pivots in the interior wall of the middle ear Causing movement of the fluid inside &lsquo;the cochlea. The cochlea is shaped like a snail curled around on itself. Inside the snail shaped bone are three tiny canals with very complex microscopic structures.</p>

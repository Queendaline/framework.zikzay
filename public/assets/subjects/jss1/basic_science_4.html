<h3>Environmental Hazards III</h3>
<h3>Topic: Desertification</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Unit 1</h4>
<p><strong>&nbsp;Meaning of Desertification:</strong> Desertification is a progressive of loss of soil fertility through the destruction the structure and composition of the soil, which doesn't permit good agricultural production or the existence of a vegetation with varied natura species. Desertification can also be defined as the degradation of land in arid, semi-arid and sub-humid dry areas, due to loss of vegetation, and soil moisture caused mainly by climatic changes and human activities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;A desert is a large area of land that has very little water, very few plants growing on it and with large quantities of dry and hot sand dunes. The process of converting a useful land into a desert is desertification called desertification.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h4>Unit 2</h4>
<h4>Geographical Spread of Deserts in the World</h4>
<p>Deserts are widely spread in the world.</p>
<p>Some of them are:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Sahara Desert:</strong> This is the largest hot desert in the word. It is located in Africa. About 2 million people live in the desert. Most of them are Arabs or Berbers. Some people live in mud houses that are painted white. This is so to keep out heat during the daytime and protect the people from cold evenings. Nomads in Africa live in tents and move around all year in search of areas with water.</li>
<li><strong>Kalahari Deserts:</strong> &nbsp;This is located in southern Africa and covers most of Botswana and parts Namibia and South Africa.</li>
<li><strong>Gobi Desert:</strong> It covers parts of northern and western China and parts of southern Mongolia. Gobi Desert is a cold desert due to its elevation above sea level. As such there are occasional snow on the dunes and even frost formations.</li>
</ol>
<p>Other deserts include Antarctic desert, Arabian desert, Patagonian Desert, Mohave desert, and Australian desert etc. Desertification affects about one sixth of the world's population, 70% of all dry lands, amounting to. 3.6million hectares and one quarter of the total land of the world.%%%%005%%%% <strong>Fig 4.1 map of Nigeria showing desert prone areas</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Desertification:</strong> it usually occurs land dunes encroach into areas where people live and gradually take over the place. The wind helps very much in the movement of sand dunes. The process is called saltation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Unit 3</h4>
<p>A combination of natural factors and human activities have contributed to desertification. Precisely, the causes are:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Over-Grazing: </strong>This means excessive use of the same pastures. When we allow livestock to graze on the grasses on an available land for several times, this may result to erosion and loss of total vegetation; and eventually desertification.</li>
<li><strong>Deforestation: </strong>Felling of trees for firewood or timber may result to desertification.</li>
<li><strong>Drought:</strong> &lsquo;This is the absence of rainfall over a period of time. As a result, plants and animals die due to lack of water. The absence of plants will imply that they will not be there again to bind the soil.</li>
<li><strong>Human Over-Population:</strong> When a certain community region is over a certain community region is over-populated, especially if the people have scarce means of livelihood, they may resort to the destruction of tropical wet and dry forest due to much practices of slash and bum and other methods of subsistence farming.</li>
<li>Excessive density of animals per area.</li>
<li>Use of pastures not adapted to soils and climate conditions.</li>
<li>Compaction of the soil surface by cattle.</li>
<li>Appearance of a trail, which favours the action of runoffs.</li>
<li>Incorrect agricultural practices like ploughing too deeply, successively and along slopes.</li>
<li>Destruction of the soil structure and incorrection works (ploughing and others).</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Unit 4</h4>
<h4>Effects of Desertification</h4>
<p>The effects or consequences of desertification are very grave, despite being a phenomenon that doesn&rsquo;t occur like a sudden catastrophe but progresses steadily in time. The main effects are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Land-Abandonment: There is land abandonment by people following the loss of soil fertility. This is because there is loss in the quality of life of the population and of course this makes them to emigrate.</li>
<li>As a consequence of these migratory movement, chaotic growth of receiving these migrates can occur, which means increasing unemployment and marginal behaviours as well as pollution and other environmental problems.</li>
<li>It reduces the number of plants and animals in a given habitat.</li>
<li>It brings about climatic changes in the due to changes in the vegetative cover.</li>
<li>Break down of agricultural production and productivity</li>
<li>Decrease of field and purchase power of the populations, poor economic development of the area etc.</li>
<li>Oscillation of product process of regional and national markets.</li>
<li>Social, economic and political instability.</li>
<li>Increase of environmental problems due to the bad use of natural resources.</li>
<li>Loss of biodiversity less variety of plants and animal.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Unit 5</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>Control of Desertification</h4>
<p>&nbsp;Desertification is quite a grave phenomenon which is on course. As a result, governments and the governed must take measures to prevent its further advance or encroachment by doing the following:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Reforestation</strong>: this means planting of new trees to replace the felled ones.</li>
<li><strong>Afforestation:</strong> This involves 2 planting of new trees in such areas they never existed. This is aimed at preventing desert encroachment. Tree planting campaign should be encouraged in schools and local government areas of state the state.</li>
<li><strong>Solar Energy: </strong>Renewable energy sources such as solar energy stoves should be encouraged. This should serve as an alternative to firewood and will reduce-the rate of cutting down of trees (deforestation) for firewood.</li>
<li><strong>Application of Manure:</strong> - Manure should be applied to the soil to enrich it and enhance crop productivity and plant growth.</li>
<li><strong>Practicing Crop Rotation:</strong> this measure is taken to protect and recover soil that is at the risk of being eroded away.</li>
<li><strong>Building Sand Fences: </strong>When sand fences are erected, this will contro! drifting of soil and sand and even help in checking erosion.</li>
<li><strong>Planting Special Crops and Trees:</strong> The planting of trees, leguminous crops and shelterbelts near our homes can assist prevent desert encroachment. Trees planted by the government should be maintained and sustained.</li>
<li>Grazing animals should be confined in their stables and should not be seen in the field grazing.</li>
<li>Over-grazing should be prohibited: In places where the cattle and other animals are left free to graze on the grasses, they should not be allowed to over-graze in a portion of land.</li>
<li>Encouraging planting of thorny bushes or obstacles to scare and keep away grazing animals.</li>
<li><strong>Planting of wind Breaks: </strong>This will help to prevent soil erosion by wind and subsequently preventing desert encouragement.</li>
<li><strong>Irrigation System:</strong> construction of dams for irrigation as well as the establishment of River Basin Development Authorities should be adopted in areas where there is drought to recover plant growth.</li>
<li><strong>Moran Population Control:</strong> Nigeria has a large population of about 140 million by 2006 census. The land is fixed while the population keeps on growing. The increasing demand for land could be over-stressing the natural resources especially in northern Nigeria and thereby making human activity a determining factor at all stages of desertification. Consequently, measures should be taken to check human population growth such as family planning programme.</li>
</ol>
<p>The establishment of Federal Environmental Protection Agency (FEPA) is a step in the right direction undertaken by the Federal Government of Nigeria for the purpose of addressing the multifarious environmental problems (including drought and desertification). The FEPA facilitated the establishment of State Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA) in the 36 states of the Federation and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). It is the mandate of SEPAs to address all the environmental problems/drought and desertification inclusive) in each State.</p>

<h3>Sub-Topic: Depletion of Ozone Layer and its Effect</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>&nbsp;Ozone layer depletion is one of the most serious problems confronting our planet earth. It is also one of the prime reasons leading to global warming. Ozone is a colourless gas which is found in the stratosphere of our upper atmosphere. The layer of ozone protects us from the harmful ultraviolent (uv) radiations of the sun. It does this by absorbing these harmful UV radiations and thus prevents these rays from entering the earth's atmosphere. UV radiations are high energy electromagnetic waves emitted by the sun which if it enters the earth&rsquo;s atmosphere can lead to various environmental issues including global warning and also a number of health-related issues for all living organisms. Thanks to ozone layer which protects us from these harmful rays. In this unit, we shall learn about substances that deplete ozone layer and its effects, ozone layer description and its location and control measures etc.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h4>Unit 6</h4>
<h4>Description of the ozone layer and its location in the Atmosphere</h4>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Ozone is a form of oxygen. It Contains three atoms, of oxygen (i.e. triatomic) (O3). Ozone is a colourless gas found in the upper atmosphere of the earth called Stratosphere. At the Stratosphere, the amount of ozone is relatively high, about 10ppm (parts per million) while at the earth surface it is about 0.04ppm. %%%%007%%%%<strong>Fig 4.5: The atmosphere showing the ozone layer.</strong></p>
<p>There are three forms (or allotropes) of oxygen and these are involved in the ozone-oxygen cycle: oxygen atoms (O or atomic oxygen), oxygen gas (O<sub>2</sub>) or diatomic oxygen) and ozone gas (O<sub>3</sub> or triatomic oxygen).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Formation of Ozone layer/Ozone Cycle</h5>
<p>Ozone 1s formed in the stratosphere when oxygen molecules (O<sub>2</sub>) absorb UV light (photons) and undergo a chemical reaction known as photo dissociation or photolysis. In this, a single molecule of oxygen breaks down into two atoms. O, Photons of energy O + O (oxygen radicals are active) UV light</p>
<p>Then the free and reactive oxygen atom now combines with an oxygen molecule (O<sub>2</sub>) to form a molecule of Ozone (O<sub>3</sub>)</p>
<p>O + O<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub></p>
<p>The ozone molecules in turn absorbs UV rays between 310 to 200nm (nanometers) wavelength (310200nm) and thereby prevent these harmful radiations from entering the earth's atmosphere. The process of absorption of harmful radiation occurs when ozone molecules split up into a molecule of oxygen gas and an oxygen atom. The oxygen atom (O), again combines with the oxygen molecule (O<sub>2</sub>) to regenerate an ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) molecule, thus the total amount of ozone is maintained by this continuous process of destruction and regeneration.</p>
<p>O+O<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;O3</p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong></p>
<ol>
<li>The amount of zone present in the stratosphere is determined by what remains from the light absorption and recombination process.</li>
<li>Ozone is also produced during thunderstorms or lightening. The electrical spark discharged by thunder is passed through ova gas (O<sub>2</sub>) in the atmosphere produce Ozone.</li>
</ol>

<li>Ozone is also formed around electrical generating plants or set.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h4>Unit 7</h4>
<h4>Importance of Ozone Layer</h4>
<ul>
<li>Ozone layer provides a natural shield from UV radiations which are high energy electromagnetic waves emitted from the sun which cause skin cancer and skin bums etc.</li>
<li>The UV rays cause cataracts of the eve which can lead to blindness in man.</li>
<li>The UV rays destroy some cyno-bacteria plant roots e.g. rice plant which yield or add nitrogen to the soil but ozone will prevent such an action.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Depletion of Ozone</h5>
<p>Ozone depletion may be seen as a slow reduction in the soil total volume or amount of ozone in the earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. Another view says that it is a steady decline of about 4% in the total amount of ozone in Earth&rsquo;s stratosphere (the ozone layer). Events in the recent years have shown that ozone layer (shield) is destroyed by substances which are of human and natural origin.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h4>Unit 8</h4>
<h4>Causes of Ozone Layer Depletion</h4>
<p>There are substances which are contributory to the depletion of ozone layer. These substances are referred to as <strong>ozone-depletion substance (ODS).</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>One of the processes leading to ozone layer depletion is by atomic halogens. The main source of these halogen atoms in the stratosphere is the photodissociation of man-made halocarbon refrigerants, solvents, propellants and foam-blowing agents such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFC), hydrogen chlorofluro carbons HCFCs, Freons and halon.</li>
<li>Similarly, bromine atoms in the form of bromofluorocarbons (BFCs) commonly called halons release bromine atoms which move to the stratosphere also catalyzing the breakdown of ozone layer.</li>
<li>Burning process, exhaust fumes of motor cars and generating sets.</li>
<li>Naturally, some important radicals that have been associated with ozone layer depletion are hydroxyl group (-OH) and nitric oxide (NO-) both have natural and man-made sources.</li>
<li>It has been found that large volcanic eruptions have been shown to have massive ozone depleting effects as observed, for example, with the 1991 eruption of mountain pinotubo in the Philippines. Such eruptions can layer Pour hydrochloric acid (HCL) to as ozone-depletion substance directly into the stratosphere causing ozone-depletion since it contains chlorine.</li>
<li>Space shuttle can also release HCL to the atmosphere resulting in the depletion of ozone layer.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Unit 9</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>Effects of Depletion of Ozone Layer</h4>
<p>&nbsp;As ozone layer depletes in the stratosphere, it forms a &ldquo;hole&rdquo; (or a depression) in the layer. This hole enables harmful UV rays to enter the Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. UV rays of the sun are associated with a number of health related and environmental issues. Let us take a look at how ozone depletion affects different life form.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h5>Impact on Humans</h5>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Skin Cancer</strong>: Exposure to ultraviolet rays poses an increased risk of developing several types of skin cancers, including malignant melanoma, basal and squamous cell carcinoma.</li>
<li><strong>Eye Damage</strong>: Direct exposure to UV. radiations can result in photokeratitis (show blindness) and cataracts.</li>
<li><strong>Immune System Damage:</strong> Effects of UV include impairment of the immune system. Increased exposure to UV ray&rsquo;s weakness the response of the immune system.</li>
<li><strong>Accelerated aging of Skin:</strong> Constant exposure to UV radiation can cause photo allergy which results in the outbreak of rash in fair-skinned people. Also, an increase in the amount of UV rays results to increased production of vitamin D which protects the skin against cancer in man.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Other effects</strong>: Ozone layer depleting chemicals can cause difficulty in breathing, chest-pain, throat irritation and hamper lung functioning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Impact on Amphibians</h5>
<ul>
<li>Hampers growth and development in larvae.</li>
<li>Changes behaviors and habitats.</li>
<li>Causes deformities in some species</li>
<li>Decreases immunity. Some species have become more vulnerable to diseases and death.</li>
<li>Retinal damage and blindness in some species.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Impact on Marine Animals and Ecosystem</h5>
<p>In particular, Plankton (Phytoplankton and Bacterioplankton) are threatened by increased UV radiation. Marine phytoplankton play a fundamental role in both the food chain as well as the oceanic carbon cycle. Planktons play an important role in converting atmospheric carbondioxide into oxygen.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h5>Impact on plants.</h5>
<ul>
<li>In some species of plants, UV radiation can alter the time of flowering as well as the number of flowers.</li>
<li>Plant growth can be directly affected by UV radiation. Despite mechanisms to reduce or repair these effects, physiological and developmental processes of plants are affected.</li>
<li>Ozone produced at the ground level by exhaust fumes of motor vehicles and generating sets is dangerous to human health.</li>
<li>The depletion of ozone layer results IN cooling in the stratosphere which invariably affects global warming and melting of ice by reducing the occurrence of these phenomena.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Unit 10</h4>
<h4>Control Measures on Ozone Layer Depletion</h4>
<p>Ozone layer depletion is something that affects not only a country or region but the whole world is vulnerable to its after effects. It is important for each and every one of us to take actions to reduce ozone layer depletion</p>
<ul>
<li>Nations all over the world should observe the 1987 Montreal Protocol agreements reached on the reduction and control of industrial chlorofluorocarbons.</li>
<li>There should be international regulations in the use chlorofluorocarbons.</li>
<li>The use of chlorofluorocarbons compounds in aerosol cans propellants, Freons and halons should be stopped. Compounds that do not produce chlorine atoms which are more environmentally friendly may be obtained through scientific research.</li>
<li>Bromofluorocarbon compounds that release bromine to the environment should be banned.</li>
<li>A conscious effort should be made by all and sundry and reduce ozone layer depletion by buying recycled products saving of energy, using a &lsquo;public&rsquo; transport and. thereby reducing the number of motor cars on the road and quantities of CFCs emissions in the atmosphere.</li>
<li>Bush burning and all burnings should be banned.</li>
<li>Public education will help in creating and spreading the awareness on the dangers in using CFCs.</li>
<li>Individuals efforts will go a long way in saving the earth's blanket (shield) and keep our planet earth livable for us and our future generations.</li>
<li>Students should identify and list sources of CFCS.</li>
</ul>

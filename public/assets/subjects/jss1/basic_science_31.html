<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Stance </strong></p>
<p>Stance varies depending on the dominant hand of the boxer. If a boxer is right-handed, the left leg is usually in front while the left shoulder tits forward. However, if the boxer is left-handed (South paw) the right leg is in t and the right shoulder is in front n modem boxing there is no definite stance as smart and fast boxers are ways on their toes. This enables them to release jabs on their opponents without receiving any <strong>Foot work</strong> -This is a skillful movement of one&rsquo;s feet especially in dancing or playing a sport such as boxing, soccer, etc. A successful jab 3n an opponent is primarily brought about by a good footwork. It is also in attack and defense.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>types: The right cross and the left cross for the left-handed or south paw. The cross punch pierces any line of defence to its target-the chin.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Attack </strong></p>
<p>It is a forward movement into an opponent in order to score points using any of the punching techniques. In any successful attack an opponent is not given a chance to retaliate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Dodging </strong></p>
<p>Dodging simply means moving away from danger, so in bonding, it is moving away from the opponent&rsquo;s punches. This could take the form of bending low to avert a possible jab or hook from an opponent or stepping back with the head tilted backward, to avoid across or an uppercut.</p>

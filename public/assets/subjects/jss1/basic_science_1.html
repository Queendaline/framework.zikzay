1&&&Chapter 1&&&Family traits (Genetics)&&&<h2>Topic 1</h2><h3>Learning about your environment</h3><h3>Topic: Family traits (Genetics)</h3><p>The cause of similarities and difference is explained by the science of Genetics. In this unit, we shall</p><p>Learn how certain biological traits or characteristics or genes are transmitted in the continuation of life.</p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h4>Unit 1</h4><h4>Cellular basis of genetic inheritance.</h4><p>The bodied of all living things (plants and animals) are made up of cells. These cells are very tiny(microscopic) and cannot be seen with the naked eyes. At the centre of the cell is the nucleus which controls all the activities of the cell.</p><p>Inside the nucleus are found dark-stained thread-like structures known as chromosomes. These chromosomes carry hereditary materials (i.e genes).&nbsp; These genes in turn determine an organism&rsquo;s characteristics and transmit from one generation to another.</p><p>During sexual reproduction in man copies of genes containing the de-oxyribonucliec acid (DNA) from parents combine in a special way to give a particular trait. The result is a little bundle of joy with physical traits. From both sides of the family. In a family, gene combinations or interactions or reshuffling result to children with different phenotypic features. This is called variation.%%%%001%%%%</p><h4>Unit 2</h4><h4>Physical traits that run in the family</h4><p>These are:</p><ul><li>Colour of the eye, hair, skin, etc.</li><li>Height (Tall or Short).</li>eye.</li><li>Ability to roll tongue into a tube shape.</li><li></li><li></li><li>Eye dominance (or squint-eye) tendency to use one eye or to close the eyes partly.</li><li>Blood Group.</li><li>Being right-handed or left-handed.</li><li>Cross your left thumb over your right when you interlock your fingers.</li><li>Adorable freckles.</li><li>A dimple in chin or each squeezable check.</li><li>Hairline (like having a widows-peak or not).</li></ul><p>It should be noted that physical traits passed on by genetics are what makes your little one look like you. or his/her parent or an improved version or both. While many inherited traits are plain seeing, however, there are some that require a little digging to find, which can make for a fun family time.</p><p>Physical trait we are see are called phenotypic traits. To qualify as an inherited phenotypical trait, but having curly hair is. In phenotypic expression of a particular trait, each gene controls an enzyme that makes a particular trait. For example, a person with black eye pigment. A person with blue eyes lacks skin pigment called melanin while an albino or white skinned individual it or DE pigmented.</p><p>During sexual reproduction in man, copies of genes containing the de-oxyribonucliec acid (DNA) from both parents combine in a special way to give a particular trait.

These factors can nutrition, pollution, altitude, temperatures, and exposure to sunlight. For example, if a child has a potential to grow six feet tall, but is malnourished, there is a chance that he might never reach that height. Or two parents have dark skin and move to an area that is very sunny most of the year, their children may have lighter-coloured skin than they. Therefore, heredity and environment make up the gene traits.</p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h3>Unit 3</h3><h3>Meaning of Dominant and Recessive Traits.</h3><h3>Mendel&rsquo;s Experiments</h3><p>Gregor Mendel carried out several experiments on pea plant. In one such experiments, he chose a pure-breeding tall pea plant and crossed it with dwarf plant. He did this by taking pollen from one plant and dusting it on the stigma of the other. He took precaution and made sure was not contaminated with its own pollen or that of any other plant. Fertilization took place resulting to seed formation. The seeds resulting from this cross were collected and sown. It was found out that all the seeds gave birth to tall plants, no dwarf plant was produced at all. These plants belong to what he called the first filial generation (or F1 for short).</p><p>Furthermore, one these tall F1 was then self-pollinated, took precautions and made sure that it was not pollinated by any other kind of pollen. The resulting seeds were sown and offspring (belonging to second filial generation (F2 for short) were carefully examined. Mendel found that the F2 plants were a mixture of tall and short pea plants. In one particular cross, he observed that the proportion of tall to dwarf plants approximates to a ratio of 3:1.</p><h4>Conclusion from Mendel&rsquo;s Experiment</h4><p>No medium- sized plants were formed from neither then F1 nor F2 generations. Hence, inheritance is not a process in which the features of the two parents are balanced together to produce an intermediate result. Rather it is process in which definite structures or particles (genes) which may or may not show themselves in outward appearance of the organisms, are transmitted from parents to offspring.</p><p>Secondly, no dwarf plants were formed in the F1 generation despite the fact that one of the parents was dwarf. This shows that, as the factor for dwarfness fails to show in the F1 generation, it must in some way be swamped by the factor for tallness. This means that the gene for tallness is dominant to the gene for dwarfness, and the latter said to recessive.</p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h3>Unit 4</h3><h3>Genes and their Pattern of Transmission</h3><h3>Phenotype and genotype</h3><p>The pattern of gene transmission from one generation to another can be illustrated using a genetic diagram. This is as follows: The gene for tallness is represented by T, and the gene for dwarfness by t. Each contains a pair of identical genes. TT in the case of a tall plant, tt in the case of dwarf plant. When organisms (plant or animal) contain identical genes like this, it is said to be homozygotous.&nbsp; The genetical constitution of an organism is known as its genotype. The outward appearance of the organism, that is the way the genes, express themselves the structure of the &nbsp;%%%%003%%%%004%%%%</p>

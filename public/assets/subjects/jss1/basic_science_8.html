<h3>YOU AND ENERGY</h3>
<h3>Topic: Light Energy</h3>
<h4>&nbsp;Unit 1</h4>
<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>&nbsp;Light enables us to see things around us. Light is a form of energy called luminous energy. The sun is our most important source of light. Light provides all living things on earth with energy</p>
<h5>Sources of Light</h5>
<p>There two sources of light energy which include:&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Natural Sources</strong>: these are those &gt; sources of light that give out light on their own. Example; the sun, the stars, fire flies, diamond etc</li>
<li><strong>Artificial Sources</strong>: these are those. Sources that cannot give out light on their own; they depend on the natural source of light. Examples are moon, the candle light, torchlight, fluorescent light, electric lamp and so on.</li>
</ol>
<h5>Rays and beams of light</h5>
<p>The direction or path along which light energy travels is called a ray. The arrow on the light ray indicates the direction of the ray. A collection of rays of light is called <strong>a beam of light.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>There are three Types of Beams</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Parallel Beams:</strong> this is one in energy which light rays are parallel to one another. Example; the search light Sources of light gives off a parallel beam of light. %%%%011%%%%</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Convergent beams: </strong>This is one in which the rays converge or meet at a point. Example, a hand lens can be used to produce such a beam.</li>
<li><strong>Divergent Beam:</strong> This is one in which the light rays come from a point and spread out or diverge from the source. Lamps produce a divergent beam. %%%%013%%%%</li>
</ol>

<h4>Unit 2</h4>
<h4>Transmission of Light</h4>
<p>Light is an electromagnetic wave. Rays of light can be transmitted through a vacuum, transparent bodies, translucent bodies and opaque bodies. The amount of light passing through a body depends on the nature of the body. Light passes through a vacuum and reaches us on the earth&rsquo;s surface. When light passes through a vacuum and very little is absorbed, we call such material <strong>transparent</strong>. Example glass, water, etc. <strong>Translucent</strong> bodies allow small amount of light to pass through them Examples include: frosted glass, tissue paper, oiled paper, etc. They are not clear because we cannot see objects through them. There are opaque materials which do not allow light to pass through them at all. All the light is which either reflected or absorbed. Examples are wood, bricks, wall, metal sheets.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h5>Unit3&nbsp;</h5>
<h5>Reflection of Light</h5>
<p>When we shine light (say from torch) on a surface, part of the light will pass through, some will be absorbed by the surface, while some part will be thrown back or sent back. The ones thrown back are referred to as reflected rays.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Reflection of light is sending or, transmission of Light throwing back light wave When it strikes a surface. Most objects can reflect Light, Objects with smooth, shiny or light coloured surfaces can reflect more light than with rough, dull or dark coloured surfaces.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Types of Reflection</h5>
<ol>
<li>Reflection from Smooth surfaces like mirrors is regular. The mirror produces regular reflection because parallel beam of light is reflected in one direction and not scattered. This is due to the smoothness and high polished nature of the reflection.</li>
</ol>
<p>Reflection from rough surfaces is irregular or diffused. This is because of lack of smoothness or grain of the surface. Paper and clothing material give out irregular reflection. The reflection is said to be scared or diffused reflected. %%%%015%%%% <strong>Fig 8.2&nbsp; Reflection on both rough and smooth surfaces</strong></p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h5>Laws of reflection</h5>
<ul>
<li>The incident ray, the reflected ray and the normal, at the point of incidence all lie on the plane.</li>
<li>The angle of incident is usually equal to the angle of reflection.%%%%018%%%%<strong>Fig 8.3</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h5>Image Formation by a plane mirror</h5>
<p>when you look at mirror you see the picture of yourself in the mirror which is an image. An image is something that looks very real but not the real thing itself. An image is formed when reflecting surface reflect most of the light that falls on it.</p>
<p>The image always appears to be of the same size. It appears to lie as far behind the mirror as the object is in front of the mirror. The image appears to have been turned around sideways (lateral inversion).</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h5>Description</h5>
<p>When an object is placed in front of a plane mirror, two ray&rsquo;s AC and AD strike the mirror at points C and D. After reflection, they appear to the eye at E as if they were originating from B. The eye sees the image at B in such a way that ANB is perpendicular to the, Mirror.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h5>Characteristics of Image Formed by a plane mirror</h5>
<ul>
<li>The image is the same size as the object.</li>
<li>The image is formed at the back of the mirror (virtual) or the image is not real</li>
<li>The image is laterally inverted (appears to have been turned around).</li>
<li>The image is as far behind the mirror as the object is in front of the Mirror:</li>
</ul>

<h4>Unit 4</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;Refraction of Light</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes, light rays&rsquo; incident on a surface may not bounce off from the surface, instead the light rays pass through it but in doing so, they bend from their original path. This phenomenon is called refraction. Refraction therefore is the bending of light ray as it passes from one transparent substance to another such as air to water and vice versa. In other words, refraction is the bending of a light ray as it crosses the boundary between two media of different densities, thus causing a change in its direction. &nbsp;</p>
<p>This bending by refraction makes it possible for us to have lenses, magnifying glasses, prisms and rainbows. Even our eyes depend upon this bending of light. Without refraction, we would not be able to focus light onto our retina. Change of speed causes change of direction. That is, light changes its direction whenever it travels at an angle to a substance with a different optical density (refractive index). This change of direction is caused by a change in speed. when light travels from air to water, slows down, causing it to continue to travel at a different angle or direction as shown. &nbsp;</p>
<h4>Unit 5</h4>
<h4>Laws of refraction</h4>
<p>The laws of refraction were propounded by Snell and the law states thus;</p>
<ul>
<li>The incident ray, the normal and the refracted ray, at the point of incidence all lie on the same plane</li>
<li>The ratio of the sine of angle of incidence to the sine of angle of refraction is constant for a given pair of media i.e $\frac{sin~i}{sin~r}$ = constant</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;Hence $\frac{sin~i}{sin~r}$ &nbsp;= &micro;</p>
<p>&nbsp;where &micro; = refractive index of the material, i</p>
<p>&nbsp;This is known as Snell&rsquo;s law. %%%%021%%%%<strong>Refraction of light</strong></p>

<h4>Unit 6</h4>
<h4>Effects of Refraction</h4>
<p>The effects of refraction at plane surfaces help us to explain our day to day observations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>A partially immersed straight stick or pencil appears bent at the boundary between the air and the water. But if the pencil/stick is standing upright, it appears shorter.</li>
<li>A coin in a bow or glass beaker is invisible to the observer when no water is in the bowl, but if sufficient water is poured into the bowl, refraction will occur at the air &mdash; water boundary, then it will cause the coin to be visible to the eye and it would appear to be raised above the depth of the beaker.</li>
<li>A swimming pool appears shallower when we look down into it than it actually is. Hence, refraction of light at the surface of water makes pond and swimming pools Parts of the Eye and appears shallower than they really are. This shows that apparent depth is smaller than the real depth. For this reason, amateur swimmers should always check the mark of the depth before entering the pools otherwise, they may get drowned.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Unit 7</h4>
<h4>(The human Eye) Vision</h4>
<p>Our eye is the most important natural diaphragm which has a small optical instrument. The eye is nearly spherical in shape with a slight bulge in front part. The eye is the sense organ for sight; it enables us to see things like the camera. The eye has a refractive system containing a converging lens which forms the image of the object in front of the eye.%%%%023%%%%<strong>The Eye</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h5>Parts of the eye and their functions</h5>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Cornea: </strong>This is clean and transparent protective shield of the lens which allows light into the eye.</li>
<li><strong>Aqueous Humour: </strong>here, the space behind the cornea and lens is filled with liquid is to keep the eye in its spherical shape.</li>
<li><strong>The Iris: </strong>Just behind the cornea is a dark coloured muscular diaphragm which has a small opening in the middle called the pupil; which regulates the amount of light entering the eye.</li>
<li><strong>The Pupil:</strong> is the small circular opening of the iris. The pupil appears black because the inner layer of the eye, the choroid, is black and has no light to reflect.</li>
<li><strong>The Eye Lens:</strong> the eye lens is a convex lens made of a transparent jelly-like proteinous material. It is the eye lens that focuses the light from the object on to the light sensitive retina.</li>
<li><strong>The Retina:</strong> the inner back surface of the eyeball is called retina. It is a semi-transparent membrane which is light-sensitive. It is on the retina that the image is formed.</li>
<li><strong>Optic Nerve:</strong> the optic nerve is connected to the retina. The work of the optic nerve is to convey the sensation of sight to the brain.</li>
<li>T<strong>he Ciliary Muscles:</strong> these muscles by their contraction and expansion alter the focal length of the lens, changing its shape.</li>
<li><strong>The Blind Spot:</strong> it is a spot at which the optic nerve enters the eye and is insensitive to light.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Accommodation of the Eye </strong></p>
<p>Accommodation is the ability of the eye to alter or adjust the focal length of the lens so as to form Clear images of the objects at different distances on its retina. This adjustment is brought about by the action of the ciliary muscles. %%%%025%%%%</p>

<h4>Unit 8</h4>
<h4>Dispersion and Rainbow</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When light from the sun is directed obliquely (ie, directed at an angle) to the triangular glass prism, the rays would be refracted by the prism and different coloured patches of light are obtained on a white screen behind the prism. (</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: the coloured pattern is known as spectrum of white light, which include violet, indigo, blue, green, yellow, orange, red (VIBGYOR) or (ROYGBIV). The wavelength of the light. determines the colour at any point.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Dispersion</strong> is defined as the Separation of white light into its through a glass triangular prism. Rainbow is an example of dispersion. Tiny droplets of water refract the white light from the sun and create a Spectrum of colours similar to what happens in a prism. Since the droplets are spheres, &ldquo;the light is reflected internally in the droplets and the direction of the light. That is why the sun will always be behind you when you see a rainbow.</p>

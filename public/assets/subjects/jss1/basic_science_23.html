<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In metal work, metal joining is a very important aspect of metal work practice. It is hardly possible to fabricate a metallic object without the need to join metal pieces. Hence there are various methods of doing so. Soldering and brazing are some of the methods used for joining metals quickly.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

<h4>Meaning of Soldering, Brazing and Methods of joining Metals</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are five principal methods of joining metals. These are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Soldering</li>
<li></li>
<li>Welding</li>
<li>Riveting</li>
<li>Bolts and Nuts.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Soldering, brazing, welding, and riveting are permanent methods. That is to say that metal pieces joined by any of these four methods cannot be Separated without the risk of damage. The first method allows dissembling anytime it is desired. The first three methods mentioned above can only be brought about through the application of heat, but the other two methods are carried out at normal temperatures. When properly done, ail these five methods produce very strong joints.</p>

<h5>Meaning of Soldering&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h5>
<p>Soldering is a process whereby a material known as solder is melted between two metallic surfaces so as to join them together. This solder is a metal alloy whose melting point is lower than the melting points of the metals to be joined.</p>
<p>There are Two Types of Soldering, Namely; Soft Soldering and Hard Soldering. The principal distinguishing feature between the two of them is that the former occurs at temperatures much lower than those of them are Carried out at temperatures, which are not above 425&deg;C. Furthermore, joints &lsquo;produced through hard soldering are much stronger than those produced through soft soldering.</p>
<p><strong>Soft solders are largely alloys of tin and lead</strong>. Their strengths depend on the relative percentages of these two elements. Most hard solders are alloys of mainly silver, with copper and zinc added. Materials such as antimony, bismuth, and cadmium are added to solders so as to obtain. certain desirable properties.</p>
<p>Several non-ferrous materials, for example silver, lead, copper, brass, tin, gold, are readily soldered. Ferrous metals such as steels and irons are however not easily soldered.</p>
<h5>Meaning of Brazing</h5>
<p>Although brazing is a distinct metal joining process, it is similar to soldering. The principal difference between brazing and soldering is that the former takes place at temperature higher than 425&deg;C while the latter takes place at lower temperature.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Brazing involves Melting a nonferrous filler</strong> metal at the point contact of two metallic surfaces order to join them. This filer must have a melting point lower than the melting points of metals to be joined. The metals being joined are not melted during brazing. Brazing is particularly useful in joining dissimilar metals as well as metals which are difficult to weld. It produces very strong joints which is skillfully done, the finishing usually, is attractive and neat.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>There are Three Common Types of Brazing</h5>
<p>Each one takes its name from the filles metal used. There is <strong>copper brazing, silver brazing and aluminium brazing.</strong> The first makes 4 use of alloys of copper and it is done at temperatures ranging from 109&deg;C to 7 1150&deg;C. The second takes place at, temperatures ranging. from 63&deg;C to. 84&deg;C and it makes use of alloys of: silver such as silver zinc and silver! brass. The last, which makes use of: aluminium-boron and aluminium-nickel takes place at temperatures of 57&deg;C to 64&deg;C</p>

<h4>&nbsp;Unit 2</h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>Soldering tools</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;There are three essential soldering tools. These are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Heat Source</li>
<li>Solder, and
<ul>
<li>Flux</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Apart from these, there is a need for a stationary surface upon which the metals to be joined, or the job being worked upon are placed. A workshop table fills this need. There is a number of devices used for producing heat needed for soldering. Typical among these are the soldering iron, the flame heater, the gas torch, and the heated pot.</p>
<p>The soldering iron operates on the principle of the joule heat. When electricity is fed into it, heat develops in its heating element and this is applied to the solder through its top. The eldering iron is useful for heating light such as electrical terminals and in sheet metal joints. The soldering iron is not suitable for heavy work. The name heater makes use of electricity to generate heat.</p>
<p>The gas torch produces heat by burning a mixture of a combustible gas air. It has a regulating device for controlling the flame emitted at its nozzle. When being used, its flame is directed at the solder placed on the gap between the surfaces to be joined. The solder melts and fills the gap. The heated pot takes the form of a bow in which solder is placed. Heat applied to the bow melts the solder. The joint to be soldered is then introduced into the molten solder and allowed to remain&rsquo; there for a short time interval. After the time interval, the joint is lifted from the pot and allowed to cool. The solder hardens forming a strong joint.</p>
<p>Solders are made in various forms. Some of these forms are coiled wire, long thread, straight wire, bars, sheets, and pastes. The choice of a suitable form depends on the technique of soldering and the kind of job to be done.</p>
<p>Fluxes are made in form of paste or powder. Also, they are available in wire form wherein they are made as the interior core of solder-flux combinations.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Brazing Tools </strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The equipment essential to brazing comprises the following: (a) Heat source. (b) Filter metal, and (c) Flux</p>
<p>There are several devices through which heat can be supplied for the purpose of brazing. Some of these are gas torch, electric heater, furnace, and heated bowl. A gas torch burns a mixture of a combustible gas and air, thus, producing a flame which is directed at the joint being brazed. This is a manual method for brazing fairly small metallic parts. Heating in a furnace is used whenever particularly high temperatures are required or there is a need to braze under controlled conditions. The heated bow is used whenever there is a need to dip the joint inside the melted filler metal. This method is employed in manufacturing machine components.</p>
<p>The filler metal is made in form of wires, rods, rings, and plates. It may also be manufactured to conform to specified shapes. Filler metals are alloys of copper, silver, or aluminum. Brazing fluxes exist in the form of powders, or pastes. Zinc chloride and ammonium chloride are common fluxes.</p>

<h4>Operations, Types and Uses</h4>
<p><strong>Soldering is accomplished by taking the following steps:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The metal surfaces to be joined should be thoroughly cleaned of and such impediments.</li>
<li>chemical solvent, steel wool, or emery paper can be used for this purpose. If this step is not undertaken, the Solder will not be able to adhere strong to the surfaces.</li>
<li>The solder to be used should have a chemical called flux applied surfaces. Flux dissolves any oxides present on the surfaces being joined, prevents oxidation during heating, and improves the following ability of the solder after melting. Zinc chloride and ammonium chloride fluxes are common, the former being used mainly for copper alloys. For soldering electrical connection and &lsquo;electronic circuits, a non-corrosive flux, for example, rosin is used.</li>
<li>The surfaces to be soldered should be set, such that a gap of 4 function of a millimeter should between them. Feed the solder to the gap and apply heat on the solder to the gap and apply heat on the solder at the gap so that the solder melts and fills the gap. The solder wets the surfaces and penetrates the gap.</li>
<li>The soldered joint should be kept motionless and allowed to cool. At it cools, the melted solder hardens and rigidly binds the surfaces.</li>
<li>Use a wire brush to clean off flu residues at the soldered joint.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Brazing operation:</strong> The first step in brazing is to thoroughly clean the surfaces to be joined. After cleaning the surfaces are then set such that gap of a fraction of a millimeter exists between them. Next, a filler metal is placed at the joint which is to be brazed. The filler metal ought to be coated with a brazing flux. The flux prevents oxidation on the surfaces to be joined and also makes the filler metal to flow more readily when it is melted. The heat is applied at the joint. The filler metal melts, wets the surfaces and fills the tiny gap. As the filler metal cools, it hardens, thus forming a strong joint.</p>

<h3>Topic: Orthographic Projections</h3>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h4>Unit 1</h4>
<h4>Meaning</h4>
<p>The second broad class of drawings comprises orthographic drawings. It shows all the details of an object and hence are the most useful of all technical drawings. They are indispensable in the final stages of design of an object or structure. They are the only drawings upon which fabrication or construction of objects, machines and structures can be based unlike pictorial drawings. Orthographic drawings do not show objects the way they will appear when viewed by the eye. They rather show how an object will appear when viewed one face at a time. Thus, interpretation of orthographic drawings can be made only by someone trained in it. Orthographic drawing is the best way of representing an object on a plane surface. In this method of representation, different views of the object are drawn separately, but they are all arranged at right angles to one another on the paper Although tt takes more time and may seem more difficult to draw than the pictorial drawings, orthographic drawings however have the following advantages;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Unit 2</h4>
<h4>Advantages of Orthographic Projections</h4>
<ul>
<li>Each view shows visible and hidden views. The combination of two or more views gives a precise idea of the object.</li>
<li>Circles, area, and lines appear on &lsquo;he drawings exactly as they are on the object.</li>
<li>When pictorial, drawings can show a maximum of three Views of an object, orthographic&nbsp;</li>
<li>Also, whereas the three views of an object must be drawn in order to understand a pictorial drawing, in many cases, just two views of an orthographic drawings typically contain three views.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Unit 3</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;Principal planes of projection&nbsp;</h4>
<p>When constructing an orthographic drawing, lines are imagined as being drawn (or Projected) from the object to three mutually perpendicular surfaces called horizontal plane, can be better understood by thinking of them as the remaining sides of cuboids, which has had its top and two from adjacent sides removed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>&nbsp;Angles of Projection</h5>
<p>When constructing an orthographic drawing, it is necessary to specify the angle of projection which is being used. expression, angle of projection refers to the quadrant of a circle in which the object being drawn is imagined to be placed. A quadrant is the fourth part of a circle. Suppose the vertical plane and horizontal plane intersect, four quadrants are produced. The quadrants covering 0&deg; to 90&deg;, 91&deg; to 180&deg;, 181&deg; to 270&deg;, and 271&deg; to 360&deg; are respectively called first, second, third, and fourth angles. Of these four angles, only two are used as angles of projection in technical drawing. These are the first angle, and the third angle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Unit 4</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;Principal Views</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Front elevation, side elevation and plan. The drawing of an object when viewed from the principal horizontal plane is called the plan. If the object is drawn when viewed from the principal vertical plane, the front elevation is obtained. if the object is drawn when viewed from the principal profile plane, the end elevation is obtained.</p>
<h5>Dimensioning Technique</h5>
<p>Any standard drawing, no matter how it has been made, is not complete if it lacks appropriate dimensions. Dimensioning starts with the preliminary stages design and continues to the final stages of design and also spills over into the construction stage, following points should be followed so as to properly dimension drawings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>A small gap should be allowed between the outline of an object and the start of a projection line.</li>
<li>The projection line should stop a short distance after the arrow tip.</li>
<li>Extremes of dimensions should be placed furthest from the object Shorter dimensions should be placed closer to the outlines but not closer than 5mm a way.</li>
<li>Dimension should be properly spaced out, etc.</li>

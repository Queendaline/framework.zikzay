<h3>Topic: Ethical Issues in Science and Development</h3>
<h4>Unit 1</h4>
<h4>The Meaning of Ethics</h4>
<p>&nbsp;Ethics is a practical science which studies the rightness and fairness, wrongness and unfairness of human behaviour and activities. It is a science which tries to direct on how actions can be right, fair, generally useful to all and beneficial for good life or good living. In other words, ethics passes judgment on actions and behaviour of man showing whether they are good, just, right, fair, beneficial or bad, unjust, wrong, unfair or even harmful to man and his environment.</p>
<p>We can define ethics as a normative Science of the conduct of human beings living in societies. A science which judges the rightness and wrongness of conduct or the goodness or badness of action. Thus, ethics is the science of conduct or science of morals concerned with human character and conducts. It is a code of moral principles that govern or influence a person's behaviour. Ethics is generally referred to as moral <strong>philosophy</strong>. It is not only a guide to human behaviour and actions but also a guide to ideas, rules, laws, norms, customs, traditions, scientific theories, application and technologies. Nothing escapes its judgment. Its major objective is to ensure that actions and behaviour are rightly done. It protects individuals from - physical, psychological, spiritual and personal harm as a result of other people's behaviour, actions, ideas or application of technologies.</p>

<h4>Unit 2</h4>
<h4>Right Wrong Application of Science</h4>
<p>Science can be said to be an investigation or inquiry of or about things using experiments and observation. Scientific activities have three major components namely scientific attitudes, scientific processes and scientific products.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Scientific Attitudes: </strong>scientific attitudes are concerned with values beliefs and scientific behaviours investigation involving.</li>
<li>Suspending judgment until Sufficient data about the problem have been collected.</li>
<li>Curiosity about things or events</li>
<li>Expecting failure where possible</li>
<li>Being open-minded.</li>
<li>Approaching issues/things objectively i.e without bias</li>
<li><strong>Scientific Processes: </strong>It establishes ways of investigating problems. These processes include:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Observation</li>
<li>Planning or designing the experiment</li>
<li>Experimenting</li>
<li>Prediction</li>
<li>Measuring</li>
<li>Classifying</li>
<li>Collection</li>
<li>Analysis or evaluation of data</li>
<li>Asking insightful questions</li>
<li>Inferring or drawing conclusion from data collected and analysed</li>
<li>Building up concepts, principles, collected and analysis made</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Scientific Products</strong>: Scientific Products are developed from the data, collected and analyzed. The analysis produces these products:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Concepts which explain ideas specifically or generally</li>
<li>Scientific principles which explain relationship of things e.g if water is exposed to the boiling point by heat, it produces vapour.</li>
<li>Theory which is a_ group of principles explaining a_ natural phenomenon and _ predicting its behaviour.</li>
<li>Laws which are universal truths established as a result of experimental findings. Generally, these scientific components can rightly or wrongly be applied. While trying to solve the society's problems and while trying to apply scientific attitudes, processes and products on human and environmental problems, care must be taken not to negatively injure the same life of the individual that we are trying to preserve or protect. Certain scientific activities which appeal superficially solvent and beneficial could have a long term or endemic negative consequences on human, non-human and environmental existence. A workable scientific method given the same conditions can be replicated anywhere any time without considering age, tribe or status. This is what is known as reliability of a true science. Any right scientific theory has universal principles which can be replicated under the same circumstances. There are basically two ways a verified and proven scientific and technological device can be applied while attempting to solve human, social and environmental problems. These two ways science and technology can be applied are: right application and wrong application.</li>
</ul>

<h4>&nbsp;Right Application of Science</h4>
<p>Generally, all researches and human activities are to better conditions of living and solving problem, all researches and human activities are to better conditions of living and solving problems Science devices findings and principles are applied to enhance chances of survival and development. Medical science or advancement in medicine, pharmacy and pharmacology when rightly applied can be used to save life and enhance quality of life. For instance, epidemiology which is a branch of medical science exposes diseases and ways they can be avoided prevented or treated.</p>
<p>In anaesthesia and army om of lumps, mumps tissues becomes possible. Skin grafting and suturing of abrasion are performed to effect healing. Orthopaedic craft helps to redress or rectify bone and nerve problems and by so doing prevent disabilities that could have resulted from fracture, breaking and dislocation of bones or arthritis.</p>
<p>Science has been righty applied to check and control human demographic strength (population) has enabled couples to conveniently do sex selection of their preferred baby, through Invitro Fertilization (IVF) (i.e test-tube) for barren women to enable couples have the joy of parenthood. It has production of <strong>condoms</strong> contraceptives and abortifacients to prevent sexually transmitted infections (STIs) unwanted pregnancies for birth control and badly, malformed foetusr. In the field of agronomy, it rightly applied to develop crop and hybridization for improved farm yield. To ensure these, insecticides, pesticides and herbicides have been developed to control disease spread, insects, pests and herbs related diseases, destructions and losses.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Unit 4</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;Wrong Application of Science</h4>
<p>Science as a device or tool in the hands of man can be misapplied in a way that it could cause disaffection, distraction, confusion or even mass destruction of lives cherished values and behaviour. Just like most things that have positive and negative effects, science when wrong has chains of negative effects on human life and societal development.</p>
<p>For instance, the excessive consumption of alcohol leads to <strong>Parkinson&rsquo;s disease </strong>excessive eating of food can lead to obesity and diabetes. Telecommunication and information gadgets can be used to track and trail e People&rsquo;s privacy, tap private discussion, spy on people, peep One's privacy, watch pornographic films, hack people's computes send threatening or unprintable massages, circulate false information propaganda, extort money from unsuspecting client, dupe, Cheat plan all manner of evils. In the field of medicine, the use of condom or contraceptives and abortifacients are wrongly applied to Promote promiscuity and abortion of unwanted pregnancies by uncommitted sexual partners.</p>
<p>The production of arms has brought about the undesirable proliferation of arms which also has led to arms race (the craze to acquire arms by countries for mutual assaults and self-defense. Rather than use them to wage wars on avowed enemies, some disgruntled social frumps use it for robbery, thuggery and assassination. They are being used today globally by Self-proclaimed terrorist groups notably Aiquaeda in Afghanistan, Boko Haram in Nigeria, Cameroon, Niger and ethic insurgent groups who use such massive destructive weapons to harass, abduct, kidnap, assault and destroy jives and properties, Unfortunately too, the atomic energy Which scientifically has expanded global development is being used negatively to destroy lives, properties and pollute the environment. The issue of genetic engineering which is clearly demonstrated in human and animal cloning is one aspect of wrong application of science. Cloning stands contrary to all known and practiced religious doctrines. It tends to consciously cause unnatural mutation of the DeoxyriboNucleic Acid (DNA) the information carbon sheet or molecule in life. Its task is to produce identical copies of biological cell or gene (DNA). This biotechnology genetic engineering or gene cloning) makes it possible to produce the same human being in several numbers identical in all ramifications. In event of this, any of these human spares could be used for all manner of experiments like the guinea pigs. This aspect of science destroys human dignity and value. It destroyed the belief that every man is precious and unique which prevents the wasting of life because human life is irreplaceable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cloning or the Recombinant DNA techniques has even gone further to experiment on the possible fusion of genes of differing plants and those of animals and man to produce life which they believed God &ldquo;could not create or produce&rdquo; this has resulted in the production of monsters. Cloning technology has been misapplied to &mdash; challenge God, destroy religious and social morality and the basis for human existence. Through the effort of a Roman Catholic pontiff Pope St. John Paul 11, cloning received international condemnation and ban.</p>

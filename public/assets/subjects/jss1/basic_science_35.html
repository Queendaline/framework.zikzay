<h3>Introduction</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Pathogens: </strong>They are germs which are capable of causing diseases in human body or animal host, example include bacteria, virus and so on.</li>
<li><strong>Diseases: </strong>The word disease could be seen as a condition which affects the normal functioning of the human body, animal or even plant.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;Diseases are classified into two broad headings</p>
<ol>
<li>Communicable</li>
<li>Non-Communicable</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>which are capable of causing diseases.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Unit 1</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;Nature of Communicable diseases</h4>
<p>Communicable are disease that can easily be passed or transmitted from one person to the other via a living agent such bacteria, viruses and fungi</p>
<p>Examples include: measles, mumps, common cold, STLs, smallpox,chicken pox, tuberculosis etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Measles (Rubeola)</strong></p>
<p>It occurs mostly in children and in adults.</p>
<p><strong>Mode of Transmission </strong></p>
<p>Transmission from person to person is more at the early stage of infection, that is, before the symptoms start to appear. The virus which causes measles is carried by droplets of moisture discharged from the mouth or nose of a sufferer. When the sufferer sneezes or coughs. So, when a healthy person come in contact with those droplets containing the virus through drinking from the same cup, kissing, inhaling the droplets, body contact, etc he or she gets the disease.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Symptoms</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>coughing and sneezing</li>
<li>running nose and eyes</li>
<li>sensitive to bright light</li>
<li>sleeplessness and restlessness</li>
<li>feels tired</li>
<li>dry cough</li>
<li>rashes on the skin</li>
<li>cracked tongue</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Prevention </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Prevention of measles is by the use of measles vaccines. Measles vaccines produce anti-bodies that protect the body from measles" invasion for many years or even for life. Again, Victims should be in quarantined for some time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Mumps</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>It is characterized by the enlargement of the salivary gland resulting in the swelling of the front of the air. Salivary gland produces saliva in the mouth.</p>
<p><strong>symptoms</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>headache</li>
<li>chilliness</li>
<li>pain</li>
<li>lack of appetite</li>
<li>fever</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>mode of transmission</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>contact with the patient</li>
<li>drinking from the same cup</li>
<li>droplets</li>
<li>sneezing</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>prevention</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>keeping the environment clean</li>
<li>patient should be in quarantine for at least one week</li>
<li>vaccination</li>
<li>rooms and clothes must be clean/observe personal hygiene</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Malaria </strong></p>
<p>it occurs when a person is bitten by a female anopheles mosquito.</p>
<p><strong>Mode of transmission</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;Malaria occurs when one or more of the three parasites are introduced into the blood by the bite of female anopheles&rsquo; mosquito that has previously bitten a person with malaria.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Symptoms</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fever</li>

<li>educate the people on how to avoid mosquito bite</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>pneumonia</strong></p>
<p>pneumonia is a disease of the lungs. The two lobes are located in a cage formed by the ribs and stemum. When the lung tissues are infected by gems and viruses, it results in pneumonia.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Causes</strong>: Germs such as pneumococcus, streptococcus, staphylococcus, viruses, etc.</p>
<p><strong>symptoms&nbsp; </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>fever</li>
<li>cough</li>
<li>breathing with difficult</li>
<li>headache</li>
<li>pains at the joints and muscles</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mode of transmission </strong></p>
<p>By droplets from a patient who sneezes or coughs.</p>
<p><strong>Prevention </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid extreme cold or extreme hot weather</li>

<h4>Prevention and Management Communicable Diseases</h4>
<p>Non &mdash; Communicable diseases are diseases that cannot be transmitted or transferred from one person to the other. They are neither contagious nor infectious. The above statement means that if you eat, drink, kiss, play with the person you will not catch the disease. Some non-communicable diseases include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sickle Cell Disease</li>
<li>Obesity</li>
<li>Kwashiorkor</li>
<li>Anemia</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>Others include </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Beriberi</li>
<li>Rickets</li>
<li>pellagra</li>
</ul>
<p>some of the above non-communicable disease will be discussed in a nut shell.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Sickle cell Disease (homoglobinopathic Anemias)</li>
</ol>
<p>Sickie cell disease is a hereditary disease passed on to a child by both parents who are healthy carriers. It is a disease of the red blood cell. In this case the red blood cell assumes the shape of a sickle instead of the normal oval shape hence the name sickle cell. Because of this shape passage of blood through small blood vessels I.e. capillaries and veins become difficult and may at times block the capillaries thereby denying some vital parts of the body blood and oxygen. This denial in particular results in frequent tiredness experiences by patients due to shortage of oxygen which acts on the food and energy liberated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Symptoms </strong></p>
<p>The symptoms of sickle &lsquo;calf include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Abdominal pain.</li>
<li>Fever</li>
<li>Dark coloured urine</li>
<li>Bone pain.</li>
<li>Leg cramps</li>
<li>Ulcer of the leg</li>
<li>Yellowish eye</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Management of sickle cell problem </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This disease is usually managed and not cured. So, as soon it is established that the person has the disease, he/she should place him/her under the care of physician.</li>
<li>Avoid areas of low oxygen such as mountain tops, fight in planes, etc.</li>
<li>Avoid strenuous exercises</li>
<li>Eat good food rich in protein</li>
<li>See the doctor as soon as crisis is suspected</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Prevention </strong></p>
<p>Before marriage, find out your partner&rsquo;s genotype. If the both of you are &ldquo;AS&rdquo;, cancel the marriage because in every four children there must be one SS which means Sickler. The SS child can come first, second, third or last. There is possibility of all being Sickler.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Obesity </strong></p>
<p>This can be defined as excess body fat, that is adipose tissues resulting overweight. It is a major health problem in developing countries because of imported carbohydrate-laden foods. The danger in obesity is that it predisposes the body to other diseases such as heart disease, diabetes and enlarged liver.</p>
<p><strong>Prevention and management of obesity </strong></p>
<p>This disease can be avoided by eating moderately. Engaging in moderate exercises. Avoiding eating in-between meals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Kwashiorkor</strong></p>
<p>This is a disease caused by a lack of protein in body&rsquo;s food. It is more prevalent in poor countries of the world such as Nigeria and other African and Asian countries.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Symptoms</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Oedema- the retention of excess water in the body which makes the protein bloated.</li>
<li>Weakness</li>
<li>Drowsiness</li>
<li>Miserable looking hairs</li>
<li>Jaundice</li>
<li>Stunted growth</li>
<li>Low body temperature</li>
<li>Immunity is weak</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Prevention </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Take the child to the doctor for treatment to avoid complications</li>
<li>Feed the child with protein rich food for full recovering and normal growth</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>Asthma </strong></p>
<p>Asthma is a disease of the lungs caused by the narrowing of the airways in the lungs. These airways are called bronchioles. Asthma is a common chronic disease in children who are exposed to tobacco smoke. The disease is characterized by incessant attacks referred to as asthmatic attacks. These asthmatic attacks don't just occur they are aggravated by certain substances such as;</p>
<ul>
<li>Pollen grains/dusts.</li>
<li></li>
<li>Emotional stress.</li>
<li>Pollution</li>
<li>Cold</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Symptoms </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Shortness of breath</li>
<li>Chest lightness</li>
<li>Wheezing</li>
<li>Coughing</li>
<li>Hay fever</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Prevention </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid cold region</li>
<li>As much as possible avoid pollen dust</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Management </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Do not expose yourself during cold weather</li>
<li>See the doctor because asthmatic attack can be frightening</li>
</ul>

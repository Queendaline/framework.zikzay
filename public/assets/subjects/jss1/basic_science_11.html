<h4>Unit 1</h4>
<h4>Electric Circuit</h4>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>An electric circuit is the path provided for the flow of electric current. An electric circuit consists of the source of electric energy (e.g a battery) connected through a conductor (e.g wire) to a load (e.g an electric bulb) and a key or switch. The switch serves to complete (close) or break (open) the circuit, an ammeter to measure the current flow, a voltmeter to measure the potential difference, a resistor or load and a rheostat to adjust the flow of &lsquo;current. The current is the same at any point round the circuit and flow of current stops when the switch is open.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>N/B: current flows from positive to negative, while electrons flow from negative to positive. </em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><strong> Voltmeter. </strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The voltmeter is used to measure the potential difference between points along a conductor. It is represented with the letter V and always connected in parallel. As shown in the diagram %%%%039%%%%<strong>Fig.11.1a Voltmeter in parallel across a resistor</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Voltmeters are constructed to have a large electrical resistance compared to the resistance across the points they are connected. Hence, it takes a negligible amount of current from the circuit. %%%%041%%%%<strong>Fig 11.1b typical picture of voltmeter</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong> The Ammeter </strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The ammeter is a device used for measuring the amount of current flowing in an electrical circuit; it is represented with the letter A and must be connected in series with the cell since it measures the amount of Current flowing in the circuit as shown below. %%%%043%%%%<strong>Fig.11:2a. Ammeter in series with the Cell</strong></p>
<p>It is usually of low resistance so that it will be capable of allowing maximum Current to pass through. %%%%045%%%%<strong>Fig.11:2b typical picture of an ammeter</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>The Resistor </strong></li>
</ol>
<p>A resistor is a device which opposes the flow of electric current in a circuit. A resistor is a component which is specifically designed to provide a known amount of resistance in a circuit. The resistance of a metallic conductor is measured in ohms (·Ω®) and represented with the letter R. It consists of a wire made of carbon or graphite wound around an insulator with free wire ends as terminals for connection.</p>
<h5>Types of Resistors</h5>
<ol>
<li><strong> Standard resistor</strong>: Standard resistors are those that have a fixed resistance values, and can be</li>
</ol>
<p>represented as shown. %%%%047%%%%<strong>Fig11.3 a standard resistor</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ol start="11">
<li>Variable resistor. A variable resistor or the rheostats are those whose resistance can be varied; it can be represented as shown %%%%049%%%%<strong>Fig 11.3b a variable resistor</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Resistors can be arranged in series or in parallel</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><strong> Resistor Series Connection </strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Series means joining side by side, end of one is joined with end of the next resistor, in this arrangement, the current passing through resistor is the Same but the potential difference across each resistor is different.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If resistors are connected in series, total or equivalent resistor is given by:</p>
<p>R=R, + R, +-R,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><strong> Resistors in Parallel Connection </strong></li>
</ol>
<p>In such arrangement, the potential difference across the resistors is the same but the current through each resistor is different.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Resistors in parallel</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here, the total or equivalent resistor is given by the equation; %%%%051%%%% <strong>Fig 11.4 Resistors both in series and parallel</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h4>Unit 2</h4>
<h4>Ohms Law</h4>
<p>The law states that the current passing through a metallic (example; wire) is directly proportional to the potential difference across its ends provided that temperature and other physical factors remain constant.</p>
<p>i.e. l ùõÇV. Therefore, V=IR, where, R = constant of proportionality which is a measure of the opposition of the conductor offered to the flow of current called the resistance</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h5>Non-Ohmic Conductors</h5>
<p>These are materials that do not obey ohms law such as Radio valves, diodes, transistors, rectifier: capacitors and gases.</p>
<p>NOTE: all materials that obey ohms law increase in temperature with increase in potential difference.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Unit 3</h4>
<h4>Factors that Affect the Resistance of a Wire</h4>
<p>The following factors affect the resistance of a (metallic conductor) wire;</p>
<ol>
<li><strong> Length of Wire:</strong> the resistance of a wire is directly proportional to its length. i.e. R ùõÇ L. Hence, an increase in length of wire brings about an increase in the resistance of wire.</li>
<li><strong> Area of Wire:</strong> the resistance of a wire is inversely proportional to its area. Hence, thicker the wire, the lesser the resistance.</li>
<li><strong> Temperature:</strong> the resistance of a wire varies directly to its temperature, R ùõÇ T Hence, an increase in the temperature of a Wire increases its resistance.</li>
<li><strong> Type of material:</strong> the resistance of a wire depends Upon the of which it is made.</li>

<h4>Fuses and Circuit Breaker</h4>
<p>&nbsp;The circuit is an absolute essential device in the modern world and one of the important safety mechanisms in your home. A fuse is an electrical device that comprises a short length of a flexible wire of low melting point. The main Purpose of the fuse is to cut off the flow of current in a Circuit when the flow of current is in excess to prevent the destruction of the appliance Connected to it or prevent fire Outbreak. When current flowing rises above that which is expected in which the fuse is connected, heat develops and cuts the fuse wires i.e. melts the fuse wire resulting in the stoppage of current flow. %%%%053%%%%<strong>Fig 11.4 A fuse</strong></p>

<h4>Unit 5</h4>
<h4>Circuit Breaker</h4>
<p>A circuit breaker is device that cuts off current when voltage level is higher than normal. It is equally an automatically operated switch designed to protect an electrical circuit from damaged caused by overload, unlike fuse which operates once and must be replaced, a circuit breaker can be reset to resume operation. %%%%055%%%%<strong>Fig 11.6. A circuit breaker</strong></p>

<h4>Unit 6</h4>

<h4>House Wiring</h4>
<p>Electricity supply in our homes are mainly from power stations by means of thick cables. It is distributed round the house to sockets, and appliances are connected to the supply of electricity by pushing plugs into the sockets. However, house wiring usually involves three types of wires: the live (L), the neutral (N) and the earth (E) wires. The live and neutral carry the current. However, the live wire is much more dangerous than the neutral because of its high voltage. The neutral wire is earthed at the power station, and so, its voltage is not as high as that of the live wire. The earth wire carries no current. It is just for safety purpose. The moment there is sign of current in the earth wire, it is an indication that the current in the circuit is faulty, the fuse would break so as to protect the electrical application in the house.</p>

<h4>Unit 7</h4>
<h4>Electrical Components Used in House Wiring</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Fuse:</strong> the fuse/cut out is the Connection between the public power supply and the house. If the Circuit is overloaded by connecting too many appliances to a socket or by something going wrong. The fuse melts and breaks the circuit and prevents damages to the appliances.</li>
<li><strong>Control Box:</strong> the control box or fuse board has a fuse in it that regulates the supply to each service unit such as the wall socket, lamp holder.</li>
<li><strong>Junction Box:</strong> this is a device that contain the wiring junctions which allow the wiring in the home to interfere with the man power supply provided by a local utility.</li>
<li><strong>Ceiling Rose</strong>: This is a service point in a building where the ceiling fans are connected</li>
<li><strong>Wall Sockets:</strong> These are service points where electrical appliances as pressing iron, television, washing machine and drying machines are connected</li>
<li><strong>Switch:</strong> device for making and breaking the connection in an electric circuit.</li>
<li><strong>Cable and wires:</strong> mental drawn out into the form of a thin flexible thread.</li>
<li><strong>Plug:</strong> Plug is used to connect an appliance to a switch.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>Overloading:</strong> an overloaded circuit is an electric circuit that is carrying more current than it is designed to handle creating a danger of fire throw overheating. Overloading occurs when too many appliances are connected to a circuit at one time.</p>

<h4>Unit 8</h4>
<h4>Electric Meter Reading and Billing.</h4>
<p>Electric energy is measured and sold by NEPA/PHCN/ now Enugu Energy Distribution Company EEDC. The EEDC staff need not to be in your house to monitor the electrical energy consumed. What they do is to install an electric meter in the house to take the measurement of energy consumed. Electrical energy consumption is measured in kilowatt Hour (KWH). One Kilowatt Hou (KWH) is the electrical energy consumed by an appliance when power of one kilowatt is used by the appliance for one hour.</p>
<p>The wire from EEDC supply passes through meter and enters the house so that consumption is captured; so EEDC staff from time to time come around to take readings from the meter and send back to their office for billing.</p>
<p>Note: billing is the total number of kilowatt Hour multiplied by the current rate in Naira. E.g. E=P x t. where E is the electrical energy, P = power, t = time.</p>
<p><strong>Example </strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Find the cost of running a 400W electric lamp for 48hours. If EEDC Charges at the of 12kobo Per KWH.</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>Total energy consumed, E = P xt Where, P = 100W, t = 48hrs, E =? 1 KWH = 12k</p>
<p>E = 100W x 48Hrs = 4800WH. inKWH,</p>
<p>we have $\frac{4800}{1000}$ =&nbsp; &nbsp;4.8KWH. Since 1KWH cos 12k</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have 4.8 x 12k, E = 57.6kobo Therefore, the cost of running the bulb for 48hrs is57.6kobo</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Find the cost of running three 200W electric bulb for 24hours, if electrical energy costs 7kobo per KWH</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution Total power consumed is (3 x 200W) = 6O0W, t = 24hrs</p>
<p>Recall, E = Pxt. E = 600W x 24Hrs = 14400WH</p>
<p>In KWH, we have &nbsp;$\frac{14400}{1000}$ = 14.4KWH</p>
<p>But 1 KWH costs/7kobo</p>
<p>E = 144x7 = 100.8koho or N 1.008k</p>
<p>Therefore, the cost of using the three 200W bulb for 24hrs is 100.8k or N1.008k</p>

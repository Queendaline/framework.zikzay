It cannot be used as raw because at that stage, it is still brittle due to some reasons among which are the air bubbles found in it.<br />Clay is then pressed by hand several times to make it pastry and remove the air bubbles and also stones and other unwanted materials. It can then be hand made to whatever material we want to form. Also, there is what we call potter&rsquo;s wheel which is used to form whatever material we need.<br />&nbsp;<br />Methods of processing clay.<br />In order to process ceramics, mud, clay is obtained and cleared of all plant material, stones, paper, metal, scraps, wooden pieces and other impurities. Afterwards, it is mixed with water and thoroughly poured until a smooth, even mixture is obtained. <br /><br />Next comes the shaping of this mixture into the desired object. This art of using earthen material to make various objects of earthenware, stoneware porcelain and others is known as pottery. A very useful tool in pottery is the potter's wheel. This device has a flat horizontal disc, which can be rotated. When in use, earthen material is placed on the disc and this disc is given a gentle spin. A potter then places his hands against the material to mould the desired object as the disc spins. <br />After shaping or moulding, the next process is baking or firing. Baking is done in a kiln or a fire. The objective of this process is to harden the moulded articles by heating them. Afterwards, the objects are allowed to cool gradually. They are now ready for use although a further process of decoration may be carried out on them before use. <br /><br />Some techniques of Decorating Pottery are:<br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Impressing and stamping.<br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;incising. <br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;carving <br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;piercing. <br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;slip decorating<br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;bumishing and polishing<br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;decorative glazing and <br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;painting. <br />The same basic processes are involved in the manufacture of high temperature bricks known as refractory bricks, red bricks, facing bricks, and others. Although, in this case, several types of machines are used since these are usually done on a fairly large scale. <br /><br />Methods of Processing Glass There are two types of glasses namely; <br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Inorganic or mineral glass, and <br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Organic or safety glass. <br />Inorganic glass is classified .as a ceramic while organic glass 's usually classified as a plastic. Most glasses in use are of the inorganic type. Basically, inorganic glass is produced by melting together various proportions of silica (SiO2), soda ash (Sodium carbonate, Na2CO2), lime stone (Chalk, CaCos) and dolomite by firing them in a furnace. All these become a molten mixture which afterwards is very slowly cooled using a process annealing. Glass results from this. <br />Cooling process: Various shapes of glass are made by blowing air into the mixture while in its molten state. All these stages are undergone through the use of appropriate tools and equipment.</p>

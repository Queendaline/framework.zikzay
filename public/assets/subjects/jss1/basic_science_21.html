<h3>DRAWING PRACTICE</h3>
<h3>Topic: One-Point Perspective Drawing</h3>
<h4>Unit 1</h4>
<h4>Meaning, Examples and Principles of One-Point. Perspective Drawing</h4>
<p>Perspective drawings are pictorial drawings which show three sides of objects at once. Of all pictorial drawings, perspective drawings are the closest to how the eye actually sees objects. Their principal distinguishing feature is that they make allowance for the fact that as an object receives from the eye, the image of it observed by the eye becomes smaller. This is easily observed in the case of very tall structures or long walls standing on the ground and looking up, the observer notices that the image of the structure gradually becomes smaller and converges to a vanishing point. Any portion of the structure beyond this vanishing point is compressed and not readily observable.</p>
<h4>Unit 2</h4>
<h4>Measuring and Comparing Given Sizes</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are two measuring scales used in making drawings. These are architects scale and the. engineers scale. The architect scale is divided into units or fractions such as found on a standard rule. It is used in marking workings or drawings for the mechanic and the building. The engineers scale is divided into decimal units&rsquo; that is 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 80 and 100 parts to an inch. It is used in map drawing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Architect's Scale</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Examine your scale and study the various graduations. On one edge you will find that the graduations are like those of a common rule. On the adjoining edge, the graduations are marked 1&frac12; at one end and 3 at the opposite end. Observe that the first large space at each end is divided into units like those of the common rule. For example, at one end the first three-inch division is marked to represent a standard rule. But the graduations are much smaller, the three-inch division represents one foot and one of its twelve quarter-inch graduations represents one - inch.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Continue to tum the scale and observe that the edges are marked into divisions of 1 and 1&frac12;, 3/4&rdquo; and 3/8&rdquo;, Ys" and 1/8", 3/16&rdquo; and 3/32&rdquo;. At each end of the scale, the first division is marked off to represent the graduations of a common rule.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The special divisions on each edge of the scale are making drawings smaller than full size and in proportion. if you wish to make a drawing quarter size or three inches to the foot, you would choose the division marked 3 and imagine that each â…” is one inch and proceed to draw.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Engineer's scale is marked to represent feet and inches, but the graduations are in decimals rather than in fractions. This scale differed from the architect's scale in that the smaller divisions of an inch, such as appear at each end of the architect's scale, appear along its full length.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Unit 4</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;Scale Drawing</h4>
<p>There are three ways of specifying scales on a drawing. They are,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Full-Size Scale:</strong> If the size of an object is neither big nor small to be contained on drawing sheet, the full-size scale will be drawn, the scale ratio is 1:1, etc. 1mm drawn on the drawing sheet represents the same1mm on the actual scale.</li>
<li><strong>Reduction (decreasing) size Scale:</strong> If the object is bigger then, the size of the drawing paper, the size (dimension) has to be reduced to be convenient for the size of the drawing paper e.g Ratios 1:2 1:5 1:10, 1:50 and 1:100 etc if ration 1:10 is used, it implies that 1mm on&nbsp; the paper represents 10mm on the actual objects.</li>
<li><strong>Enlargement (Increasing) size Scale:</strong> If the object 1s too small than the size of the drawing paper the size (dimension) has to be increased to be convenient for the size of the drawing paper e.g 5:1 10:1, 100:1, 2:1 3:1, etc If ratio 100:1 is used this indicates that 100mm on the. drawing paper represents 1mm on the object.</li>

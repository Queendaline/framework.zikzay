<h3>Brief History of Table Tennis</h3>
<p>The origin of table tennis is not clear. Some authorities said it originated in China. Others said it originated in USA, yet others said it started in England. All the same, the game was made popular by the USA. Originally, the game was known as a parlor game. After some years, the rules were standardized and it became a popular sport. It is played in almost every nation of the world today. The equipment in table tennis includes the table, the bat, the net and the ball.</p>
<h3>Basic Skills and Techniques</h3>
<p><strong>The Grip:</strong> Grip in table tennis is very important because a good and proper grip ensures good service and stroke. There are two types of grip; the forehand grip and the backhand grip. In the forehand or handshake grip, the right hand enters into the handle of the bat as if to shake hands with it. The thumb faces the left hand and the index finger, the right. The rest of the fingers curl around the handle of the bat. In the backhand grip, the side gripped by the index finger faces the table.</p>
<p><strong>The Service: </strong>The server stands a little distance away from his own area of the table with the ball on his left palm. As soon as his opponent is ready, he tosses the ball up and hits the ball down on his own side of the table before it crosses to the opponent&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p><strong>Let:</strong> This means that the service should be retaken either because the opponent was not ready when the first service was made or the served ball touched the top of the net before touching the opponent&rsquo;s side of the table.</p>
<p><strong>Strokes:</strong> Strokes are of two types: Offensive strokes and defensive strokes. Offensive strokes include the forehand drive, backhand drive and the smash while the defensive strokes include the backhand chop and the forehand chop. Strokes are meant to dislodge an opponent so that he will not be able to return the ball.</p>
<h3>Gymnastics and Aerobics</h3>

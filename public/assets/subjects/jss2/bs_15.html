<h2>TOPIC 15: BASIC SKILLS AND TECHNIQUES IN LAWN TENNIS</h2>
<p>The game of lawn tennis originated in Greece but was made popular by England in 1875. The game was introduced in the USA by Mary Outer bridge. The game came to West African countries including Nigeria through the missionaries. By 1936, Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe had established Lawn Tennis club in Lagos. The Nigerian Lawn Tennis Association (NLTA) is the governing body of the game.</p>
<h3>Basic Skills and Techniques</h3>
<p><strong>The Grip:</strong> There are two types of grip.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Shake hand or the Eastern Grip</strong>: In this case, the index finger and the thumb form a &lsquo;V&rsquo; shape on the narrow side of the handle of the racket. This is called the learner&rsquo;s grip, used mainly for forehand drive.</li>
<li><strong>The Service or Continual Grip</strong>: Here, the player holds the racket at the throat with his left hand, for a right handed player, twists a little inwards. This type of grip is for service.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>The Forehand Drive</strong>: This is the skill that is used to return the ball that is on the right hand to an opponent.</p>
<p><strong>The Backhand Drive: </strong>This is the skill that is used to return the ball that is on the left hand to an opponent.</p>
<p><strong>The Service:</strong> This is the act of putting the ball into play or starting a game. Here, the server calls the attention of the receiver before delivering the ball. A good service must have the following qualities:</p>
<ul>
<li>It must be delivered to the appropriate part of the opponent&rsquo;s side of the court</li>
<li>It must not touch the top of the net before touching the opponent&rsquo;s side of the court</li>
<li>The attention of the receiver must be drawn</li>
<li>Service must be delivered from behind the end line</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Volley and Half Volley</strong>: In volley, the ball is sent back to the opponent before it touches the ground. The ball is struck back to the sender before it bounces on the ground. In half volley, the ball is struck as it is about to rise from a bounce. Volley is an offensive skill while half volley is a defensive skill.</p>
<p><strong>The Smash/Overhead Smash</strong>: This is the act of striking an overhead ball or a lob down into the opponent&rsquo;s court with a strong force. Care should be taken not to miss the ball out of anxiety.</p>
<p><strong>The Lob: </strong>A lob is a strike that has a good trajectory into the opponent&rsquo;s court. It is usually over those at the net forcing them to back pedal or run back in case of singles game or allow one&rsquo;s partner to play in case of doubles game.</p>
<p><strong>Retrieve:</strong> this is a fast run to play a drop shot by an opponent.</p>

<h3>Equipment and Facilities</h3>
<p>These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The court</li>
<li>Racket</li>
<li>Ball</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>The Court: </strong>The singles court is 23.76m long and 8.22m wide while the doubles court is 23.76m long and 10.77m wide. The court is rectangular in shape with a concrete floor or hard court. The surface is usually rough to avoid players slipping. The court is divided into two equal parts by a black mesh net. The height of the net at the center is 0.91m and is held in place by two strong posts with the help of a metal cable. The longer part of the court is the side line while the shorter side is the baseline. The center line is midway the baseline.</p>
<p><strong>The Ball: </strong>The lawn tennis ball is constructed in such a way that it can bounce properly on touching the ground. It has a diameter of 0.6 &ndash; 0.67cm with a weight of about 58.5 grams. The players usually wear white shorts and white polo with canvas shoes.</p>
<p><strong>The Game: </strong>The game is started with a service from the right hand side of the baseline of the side that won the toss. A call must be made to draw the attention of the receiver. The game can be played by two players: that is, a player aside (singles) or four players &ndash; two players aside (doubles). There is also the mixed doubles in which case a man and a woman aside.</p>
<p><strong>Scoring:</strong> In the game of tennis, either side can make a point during rally. The first point is 15, the second point is 30, and the third point is 40. If the two sides score 40-40 it is called a deuce. At this point, a player has to score two consecutive points. If the serving side makes a point after deuce, it is called &ldquo;advantage in&rdquo; but if it is the non-serving side that gets the point, it is called &ldquo;advantage out&rdquo;. Then the next point is a game. The scoring is the same whether singles or doubles or mixed doubles.</p>

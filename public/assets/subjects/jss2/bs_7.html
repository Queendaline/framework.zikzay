<h2>TOPIC 7: FIRST AID</h2>
<p>First aid is a treatment given to a casualty to sustain life, to prevent his condition from becoming worse and to promote his recovery by an expert or medical personnel. It is also the application of accepted principles of treatment on the occurrence of an accident or in the case of sudden illness using facilities or materials available at the time. Due to the increasing number and serious nature of accidents of all kinds, the responsibility of the first aider has become greater.</p>
<h3>The Primary Objective of First Aid</h3>
<p>First aid treatment is to save life. One of the golden rules of first aid treatment is that you must make sure there is no further danger to the victim or to yourself. First aid treatment is the immediate or temporary help or assistance given to somebody who has been injured or ill before taking him/her to the hospital or the arrival of a doctor.</p>
<h3>First Aid Materials and their Uses</h3>
<ul>
<li>Plaster: Is used to keep the drug on a wound to stay for a long time and to keep flies off the wound</li>
<li>Penicillin: Applied onto a wound to make it heal faster</li>
<li>Methylated Spirit: Used for cleaning wound before proper medication</li>
<li>Cotton Wool: Used to drain bleeding and to hold drug on wound for some time</li>
<li>Iodine: Used to stop bleeding</li>
<li>Scissors: Used to cut bandages, plaster and to dress wound</li>
<li>Paracetamol: Used to lessen pain, headaches, body fatigues and so on</li>
<li>Bandage: Used to steady dislocated joints</li>
<li>Glucose: Used to recover strength</li>
</ul>
<h3>Application of Simple First Aid</h3>
<p>The cases of accidents where first aid treatment is used include the following.</p>
<h5>Simple Cuts from Sharp Objects like Knife Which Causes Bleeding</h5>
<p>The bleeding is drained with cotton wool and iodine. Penicillin is applied before covering the wound with plaster.</p>
<h5>Treatment for Burns</h5>
<p>Cover the wound with a sterilized dressing or an adhesive dressing as quickly as possible and send for a doctor.</p>
<h5>Snakebites or Scorpion Stings</h5>
<p>This can be treated by tying a rope on the leg above the bite point. A razor blade is used to make one or two marks on the bite point so that the poison can flow out.</p>
<h5>High Fever</h5>
<p>This can be treated by removing the clothing on the patient. A wet towel is then used on his body to cool down the temperature.</p>
<h5>Chemical Burns</h5>
<p>Flush with cold water immediately and apply sterilized dressing. Alkaline burns are more serious than acid burns and should receive medical attention as soon as possible.</p>
<h5>Drowning</h5>
<p>The victim is made to lie down faced up. His belly is pressed gently to release water through his mouth and nose. If the patient still does not breathe, try a mouth to mouth resuscitation by putting your mouth on his mouth and blowing air into his lungs forcefully.</p>
<h5>Treatment of Electric Shock</h5>
<p>An Electric shock is a sudden painful feeling that a patient gets when electricity passes through one&rsquo;s body. An electric shock is caused by the passage of current through the body causing a paralysis of the muscle particularly the heart muscle. Current as low as 0.02A is fatal. More damage will be caused with longer contact to the source of the current. The severity of an electric shock will depend on:</p>
<ul>
<li>The voltage of the current source</li>
<li>Moisture or water content of the skin</li>
<li>Proximity of the body to effective earth</li>
<li>Length of time of contact</li>
</ul>
<p>Speed is essential in treatment of electric shock as few minutes delay can be the difference between recovery and death. Do not touch the victim with bare hands. First of all, switch off current before attempting to remove the victim using an insulated material like dry wood, dry rope or clothing and so on. Begin artificial respiration mouth-to-mouth method.</p>
<h5>Bleeding and Breaks</h5>
<ul>
<li>Apply pressure to the bleeding point after dressing for 5 &ndash; 15 minutes. If the wound area is large, press the sides of the wound firmly but gently together.</li>
<li>Lay the casualty down in a suitable and comfortable position and lower the head if possible</li>
<li>Raise the injured part and support it in position unless an underlying fracture is suspected</li>
<li>Carefully remove from the wound any foreign bodies which are visible and can easily be picked out or wiped off with a dressing</li>
<li>Take the victim carefully to a hospital as soon as possible</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Circulation (Pulses)</h5>
<p>The pulse beat is normally taken at the front of the wrist over the radial artery, about 1cm in from the thumb side of the lower end of the forearm. The beat results from the thrust of blood from each contraction of the heart expanding the artery. The pulse may also be taken in other suitable places. The normal adult pulse rate is at least 60-80per minute, the average being 72. In infants and young children, the normal resting rate is much higher, around 90 &ndash; 140 per minute.</p>
<h3>Application of First Aid</h3>
<ul>
<li>You must make sure there is no further danger to the casualty or to yourself</li>
<li>Act quickly, quietly and methodically giving priority to the most urgent conditions</li>

<li>If it is a case of poison, make the person to vomit</li>
<li>Do not let the victim to move about until you determine the seriousness of the injury</li>
<li>Do not give liquid drug to an unconscious victim</li>
<li>Control the on-lookers and avoid panicking. Keep assuring the casualty of his safety</li>
<li>Do not allow the casualty to see his own injury</li>
<li>Dress the wound with clean materials</li>
<li>Where it involves fracture, immobilize the affected parts</li>
</ul>

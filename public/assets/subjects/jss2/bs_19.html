19&&&Chapter &&&Personal, School and Community Health&&&
<h2>TOPIC 19: PERSONAL, SCHOOL AND COMMUNITY HEALTH</h2>
<p>School health program could be referred to as that part of health education learned at school which influences the behavior of the child and school personnel health wise. For example, prevention of diseases and what to do when someone falls ill suddenly.</p>
<h3>Importance of School Health Program</h3>
<ul>
<li>To acquaint the students with the health hazards inherent in the society</li>
<li>To promote good health practice among the students school personnel and by extension, parents and sibling</li>
<li>To help the student and all around them develop positive attitudes towards health</li>
<li>To expose some superstitious beliefs and cultural barriers to health practices.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Components of School Health Programs</h3>
<p>For school health program to achieve its objectives, the under listed areas should be handled and covered by professionals.</p>
<ul>
<li>Health instruction</li>
<li>School health services</li>
<li>Healthy living and environment</li>
<li>School, home and community relationship</li>
</ul>
<h4>Health Instruction</h4>
<p>Health instruction is the aspect of health education that has to do with day-to-day teaching and learning of desirable health knowledge. This should also include: involving the students in the planning and conduct of healthy school living and health services. Students should be involved in sanitation i.e. cleaning the school compound and disposal of refuse, supervising the activities of food vendors, gathering information about health states of fellow students and reporting same to the school authorities. Health instruction should not be an all classroom affair only.</p>
<h4>School Health Service</h4>
<p>This is a design to determine the health status of the pupil, student and school personnel so as to identify any defects. It also involves making ways of presenting diseases known to the child and parents. It helps the teacher to detect early enough signs and symptoms of diseases and render emergency care. In summary, the activity under this heading can be divided into two broad groups.</p>
<ul>
<li>The simple and the ones that can be readily observed either by the teacher or the students. These include: Gait and posture, vision problem, height and weight, skin problems, paleness and so on.</li>
<li>Those that can be handled by professionals in the medical field. These include hernia, appendectomy &ndash; removal of appendix through operation, or any other case that requires opening of the body.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Healthy School Living/Healthy School Environment</h4>
<p>Healthy school environment is essential since the child spends approximately eight hours in school every school day. The under listed make for a healthy school environment.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Good water supply</strong>: Pipe borne water, preferably, should be provided in the school. In rural areas where the provision of safe and potable water is difficult, parents and teachers should make it a priority. In the absence of pipe borne water through boreholes, big water containers with taps should be mounted in the school to provide safe and potable water to the children. This serves useful purposes which include drinking, bathing and flushing of toilets.</li>
<li><strong>Good toilet system and restroom</strong>: Quite a good number of conveniences and urinals should be provided depending on the number of pupils. There should be adequate supply of water and wash hand basin for the students to wash their hands and flush the toilets. These conveniences should be properly guarded to avoid abuse.</li>
<li><strong>Good lighting and ventilation</strong>: Bright light is very important for reading so a standard classroom should have four long fluorescent tubes to give the room proper illumination. The same thing is applicable to ventilation. A standard classroom should have four big windows with two on either side. This allows for free flow of air in and out of the classroom.</li>
<li><strong>Suitable chairs and desks</strong>: Moveable seats and desks are better than the ones built together because the height of the children differs. The desk should be high to allow free movement of the child&rsquo;s thigh. The desk should not be too high or too low, too near or too far from each other to avoid any form of postural defect such as hunchback.</li>
<li><strong>First aid box</strong>: Since injuries and sudden ill health can occur anytime in the school, it is pertinent to have a well-equipped first aid kit. Teachers and senior students should have knowledge of first aid in order to assist in case of emergency.</li>
<li><strong>Safe playground</strong>: The playground should be big enough to accommodate all sporting or gymnastic activities the students will be engaged in. They must be located within the school premises and must be free from stumps, sharp objects and so on.</li>
<li><strong>Good location</strong>: Good location of a school ensures a measure of safety for the child and relative peace on the part of the parents. In view of the above, schools should be located away from hustling and bustling areas to avoid distraction. It must not be too far from the child&rsquo;s home. It should be fenced with one gate manned by gate men.</li>
</ol>
<h4>School &ndash; Home and Community Relationship</h4>
<p>School &ndash; home and community relationship has to do with the health practices in the school, at home and the community at large.</p>
<p>Community health encompasses the practice of preventing diseases, prolonging life and promoting health and wellbeing through organized community effort for the sanitation of the environment, the control of communicable infection/chronic conditions, the organization of medical and nursing services for the early diagnosis and prevention of diseases, the education of the individual in personal health and the development of social machinery to ensure everyone a standard of living adequate for the maintenance or improvement of health.</p>
<p>In civilized communities, doctors and nurses plus health and physical education professionals may decide to come together to form a team which will work with the school personnel, students, families and community based organizations in order to improve the overall health of the community. Such areas as immunization, regular cleaning and sweeping of roads in the community, regular inspection of families to ensure good drinking water, good and clean toilet system, planting of flowers and trees for beautification and fresh air and so on. The team should cover such areas as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Construction of solid building to ensure durability and good ventilation</li>
<li>Organizing lectures for pregnant and nursing mothers covering such topics as child care and family planning</li>
<li>For the youths, topics such as prevention of premarital sex, abortion, unwanted pregnancy, communicable diseases such as gonorrhea, syphilis, HIV/AIDs and Ebola should be covered to augment the efforts of the school.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Pollution</h3>
<p>Pollution could be defined as the introduction of contaminants into natural environment thereby making the environment inhabitable.</p>
<h4>Environmental Pollution</h4>
<p>This means the contamination of an environment by pollutants such as chemicals, heat, noise and any other thing that can impact the environment negatively. The advent of technology has brought with it a lot of changes in the environment. Thick forests that produce fresh oxygen are now replaced by industries that produce carbon (II) oxide. Environmental pollution is of different types. They include water pollution, soil pollution, air pollution, noise pollution and radioactive pollution.</p>
<h4>Water Pollution</h4>
<p>When contaminants enter any body of water like a river, lake, sea, stream, lakes and so on, the water becomes polluted. These contaminants in most cases are introduced into the water through human activities in the home, industry, agriculture, cooling stations and atomic reactors.</p>
<p>Pollutants from the home include waste water from toilets, kitchens, bathrooms and so on. If a river is suffocated by these wastes, there may be shortage of oxygen which affects aquatic life.</p>
<p>Industrial wastes such as oil, detergents and metals amongst others can pollute water bodies and render it unusable.</p>
<p><strong>Agricultural Pollutants: </strong>Poultry dung, urine and dropping from cattle at times find their way to the river or stream making water bad for human use.</p>
<p><strong>Cooling Stations and Atomic Reactor: </strong>Power plants and atomic reactors cool their plants with water which flows back to the body of water increasing the temperature and causing thermal pollution. Thermal pollution is an increase in the water temperature due to industrial operations.</p>
<h5>Effect or Dangers of Water Pollution</h5>
<ul>
<li>Aquatic life may be in jeopardy and at times face out right extinction if no proper attention is given.</li>
<li>The source of water for human consumption is lost</li>
<li>Fishes, shell fish such as lobsters, crabs, oysters which are the major sources of iodine for humans will be lost</li>
<li>Lakes, streams and sometimes rivers which serve as recreational facilities may be stinking as a result of pollution.</li>
<li>Water pollution can affect human health when pollutants enter the body through the skin or direct consumption of contaminated water or food. This will result to water borne diseases such as cholera, typhoid, and dysentery.</li>
<li>Hot water discharged from power plants usually change the level of oxygen dissolved in a body of water. This in effect disrupts the water&rsquo;s ecological balance leading to the death of some plants and animals in the system</li>
<li>All water pollutants are hazardous to humans and other living things</li>
</ul>
<h5>Prevention and Control of Water Pollution</h5>
<ul>
<li>Technological development has made possible the treatment of sewage before discharging it into the water bodies. So it is important to treat sewage to destroy pathogenic organisms in the sewage.</li>
<li>Wastes from industries should be channeled to covered ditches or pits as is the practice in civilized countries</li>
<li>The use of excess fertilizer and pesticides should be discouraged</li>
<li>Waste food materials, papers, decaying vegetables and plastics should be disposed properly</li>
<li>Effluents from distilleries and solid wastes containing organic matters should be sent to biogas plants for generation of energy</li>
<li>Streams, lakes, rivers and other water bodies around where oil is produces should be protected from bunkering activities to avoid spillage.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Soil Pollution</h4>
<ol>
<li>Soil pollution also known as hard pollution can simply be defined as contamination of the soil. This takes two forms namely: deforestation and dumping of solid wastes.</li>
<li><strong>Deforestation</strong>: This involves cutting or burning down all trees in a particular area. This causes soil erosion. Erosion can be brought about by two agents namely: wind (wind erosion) and water (water erosion). When the top soil is eroded, the eco system is distorted causing the soil to be polluted.</li>
<li><strong>Dumping of Solid Wastes</strong>: Dumping of solid wastes from homes and industries pollute the land and enhance degradation. Such solid wastes include rubber, paper, plastic, fabric, leather, glass and so on. Some harmful pesticides and excessive use of fertilizer in agriculture contaminate the soil by increasing the soil acidity which destroys important organisms in the soil. This creates an imbalance in the soil and also prevents natural growth of plants. Oil spillage is the worst of all forms of soil pollution. It renders the soil useless because every living thing in the area dies. Most farm land in some oil producing states such as Rivers, Delta and so on has been lost to oil spillage.</li>
</ol>
<h5>Dangers of Soil Pollution</h5>
<ul>
<li>Heaps of solid waste destroy the natural beauty of an area</li>
<li>It breeds rodents, flies, mosquitoes, and so on from where they invade homes.</li>
<li>The stench that comes out from the site pollutes the area</li>
<li>Wastes may also block the flow of water in drainage systems which results to flooding</li>
<li>Water from the solid waste site may find its way to a nearby stream or river and pollute it.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Control of Soil Pollution</h5>
<p>Soil pollution can be controlled if the following are put in place.</p>
<ul>
<li>Enforcement of better ways of refuse disposal which will include provision of incinerators, refuse recycling plants, and so on.</li>
<li>Indiscriminate felling of trees and burning of forest reserves should be prohibited by governments. This is because plants provide protective cover on the land to prevent soil erosion.</li>
<li>Government should provide well-constructed drainage systems in every city to avoid flooding</li>
<li>Soil erosion which is an aspect of pollution should be controlled by the use of contour ploughing and wind breaks</li>
<li>Grass should be allowed to grow on any unused land</li>
<li>Over grazing should be avoided</li>
<li>Intensive cropping and planting of trees should be encouraged</li>
</ul>
<h4>Air Pollution</h4>
<p>Air pollution can be defined as contamination of the air. It is caused by harmful substances in the air. Two main factors contribute to air pollution. They are automotive pollution and thermal power plants/industries.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Automotive Pollution</strong>: This type of air pollution happens as a result of increased number of vehicles on our roads. These vehicles emit gases that are harmful to the body. In the atmosphere, there are various gases having a certain amount of percentage. Any type of interference in the equilibrium of the gases becomes air pollution.</li>
<li><strong>Thermal Power Plants/Industries</strong>: These industries that are involved in the production of cement, steel, mines, petrochemicals and so on push into the atmosphere harmful solid substances such as dust, soot and radioactive materials which are not only harmful to man but also deplete the ozone layer which protects living things from the direct rays of the sun.</li>
</ol>
<h5>Sources of air pollution can be grouped under the following</h5>
<ul>
<li>Natural sources which include forest fire, volcanic ashes, dust storm, decays of organic materials and so on.</li>
<li>Manmade sources which include deforestation, urbanization and industrialization.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Effect of Air Pollution</h5>
<ul>
<li>Mammals take in oxygen and breathe out carbon dioxide. When this oxygen is polluted by things like dust, lead oxide, sulphur dioxide and so on, there is bound to be deposits in the lungs. These deposits may result in bronchitis, lung cancer, asthma and so on.</li>
<li>Carbon monoxide emitted from vehicles affect the nervous system</li>
<li>Skin cancer can result from radiation due to direct sun rays, This can only happen when the ozone layer is depleted as it is today</li>
<li>Radiation causes quite a number of damages to the body such as eye problem and destruction of immune system</li>
<li>Acid rain caused by the presence of oxides of nitrogen and sulphur in the air which form nitric acid and sulphuric acid respectively damage monuments, buildings and statues due to the presence of acid in the rain water.</li>
<li>Acid rain also increases soil acidity which affects agricultural productivity.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Prevention and Control of Air Pollution</h5>
<ul>
<li>Combustion &ndash; when organic pollutants are burnt, they become less harmful</li>
<li>Vehicles should be properly maintained to prevent pollution</li>
<li>Use of better designed equipment and smokeless fuels at home and in industries</li>
<li>Use of electrostatic precipitators</li>
<li>Plant trees. Trees absorb carbon dioxide and filter out air pollutants</li>
</ul>
<h4>Noise Pollution</h4>
<p>Noise pollution is any kind of sound that is unpleasant to the ear. Usually, it is always loud and hard. Noise pollution will always constitute a nuisance to the environment. There are two main sources of noise pollution. These are natural sources and artificial sources.</p>
<p><strong>Natural Sources</strong>: The things that constitute noise pollution naturally include volcanic eruption, wind at very high speed, fall from a big tree and any other loud and unpleasant noise that could occur without the interference of man.</p>
<p><strong>Artificial Sources</strong>: Artificial sources of noise pollution are numerous due to man&rsquo;s activities. Some of them include factories, industries, explosives, automobile, trains and so on.</p>
<h5>Effect of Noise Pollution</h5>
<p>An unwanted and unpleasant sound is a disturbance to people around that environment. In like manner, prolonged exposure to high level of noise is very harmful to hearing. Research work or reading generally cannot take place in a noisy atmosphere. It brings restlessness and confusion. No meaningful work can be done in a noise polluted area.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Control of Noise pollution</strong></li>
<li>Noise pollution in factories, industries and so on can be controlled by muffling the source of sound</li>
<li>Protective equipment should be provided for factory workers</li>
<li>Physical barriers such as vertical walls and trees reduce noise pollution considerably particularly in industries, factories and along highways.</li>
</ul>

<h2>TOPIC 22: OPERATING SYSTEM</h2>
<p>An operating system (OS) is software that communicates with the hardware and allows other programs to run. It is comprised of system software, or the fundamental files your computer needs to boot up and function. Every desktop computer, tablet and smartphone includes an operating system that provides basic functionality for the device. Common desktop operating systems include Windows, Mac OS X and Linux. While each OS is different, they all provide a graphical user interface (GUI) that includes a desktop and the ability to manage files and folders. They also allow you to install and run programs written for the operating system. While Windows and Linux can be installed on standard PC hardware, Mac OS X can only run on Macintosh computers. Therefore, the hardware you choose affects what operating systems you can run.</p>
<p>Mobile devices such as tablets and smartphones also include operating systems that provide a GUI that can run applications. Common mobile operating systems include Android, iOS and Windows Phone. These operating systems are developed specifically for portable devices and therefore are designed around touchscreen input.</p>
<p>Since the operating system serves as a computer&rsquo;s fundamental user interface, it significantly affects how you interact with the device. Therefore, many users prefer to use a specific operating system. For example, one user may prefer to use a computer with Mac OS X instead of a windows-based PC. Another user may prefer an android-based smartphone instead of an iphone which runs the iOS.</p>
<p>When software developers create applications, they must write and compile them for a specific operating system. This is because each OS communicates with the hardware differently and has a specific application program interface (API) that the programmer must use. While many popular programs are cross platform, meaning they have been developed for multiple operating systems, some are only available for a single operating system. Therefore, when choosing a computer, it is important to make sure the operating system supports the programs you want to run.</p>
<h3>Examples of Operating Systems</h3>
<p>There are many different operating systems. Each does the same thing: They control all input, processing and output.</p>
<p><strong>DOS</strong> &ndash; Disk Operating System was one of the first operating systems for the personal computer. When you turn the computer on, all you will see is the command prompt which displayed: c:\&gt;. You have to type all commands at the command prompt or command line. This is not user friendly.</p>
<p><strong>Windows</strong> &ndash; The windows operating system, a product of Microsoft, is a GUI operating system. This type of user friendly operating system is said to have WIMP features which include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows</li>
<li>Icons</li>
<li>Menus</li>
<li>Pointing device (mouse)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mac OS</strong> &ndash; Macintosh, a product of apple, has its own operating system with a GUI and WIMP features.</p>
<p><strong>UNIX</strong> &ndash; Linux (the PC version of UNIX) was originally created with a command line interface but recently have added GUI enhancements.</p>
<p>User friendly is a relative term. The current GUI provided by windows and Mac operating systems are more friendly than the previous DOS systems but still require us to conform to their specifications.</p>
<h3>What is an Operating System?</h3>
<p>The operating system is the core software component of your computer. It performs many functions and is in very basic terms, an interface between your computer and the outside world. A computer consists of several component parts including the monitor, keyboard, mouse and other parts. The operating system provides an interface to these parts using what is referred to as drivers. This is why sometimes when you install a new printer or other piece of hardware, your computer will ask you to install software called a driver.</p>
<h3>What Does a Driver Do?</h3>
<p>A driver is a specially written program which understands the operation of the device it interfaces to, such as a printer, video card, sound card or CD ROM drive. It translates commands from the operating system or user into commands understood by the component computer part it interfaces with. It also translates responses from the component computer part back to responses that can be understood by the operating system, application program or user.</p>
<h3>Other Operating System Functions</h3>
<p>The operating system provides several other functions such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>System tools (programs) used to monitor computer performance, debug problems, or maintain parts of the system</li>
<li>A set of libraries or functions which programs may use to perform specific tasks especially relating to interfacing with computer system components.</li>
</ul>
<p>The operating system makes these interfacing functions along with its other functions operate smoothly and these functions are mostly transparent to the user.</p>
<h3>Operating System Concerns</h3>
<p>As mentioned previously, an operating system is a computer program. Operating systems are written by human programmers who make mistakes. Therefore, there can be errors in the code even though there may be testing before the product is released. Some companies have better software quality control and testing than others so you may notice varying levels of quality from operating system to operating system. Errors in operating systems cause three main types of problems.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>System crashes and instabilities</strong>: These can happen due to software bug typically in the operating system, although computer programs being run on the operating system can make the system more unstable or even crash the system by themselves. This varies depending on the type of operating system. A system crash is the act of a system freezing and becoming unresponsive which would cause the user to need to reboot.</li>
<li><strong>Security flaws</strong>: Some software errors leave a door open for the system to be broken into by unauthorized intruders. As these flaws are discovered, unauthorized intruders may try to use these to gain illegal access to your system. Patching these flaws often will help keep your computer system secure.</li>
<li>Sometimes errors in the operating system will cause the computer not to work correctly with some peripheral devices such as printers.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Operating System Types</h3>
<p>There are many types of operating systems. The most common is the Microsoft suite of operating systems. They include:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Windows 10, Windows 8.1, Windows 8, Windows 7 and Windows Vista</strong></li>
<li><strong>Windows XP Professional Edition</strong> &ndash; A version used by many businesses on workstations. It has the ability to become a member of a corporate domain.</li>
<li><strong>Windows XP Home Edition</strong> &ndash; A lower cost version of Windows XP which is for home use only and should not be used at a business.</li>
<li><strong>Windows 2000</strong> &ndash; A better version of the Windows NT operating system which works well both at home and as a workstation at a business. It includes technologies which allow hardware to be automatically detected and other enhancements over Windows NT.</li>
<li><strong>Windows ME</strong> &ndash; An upgraded version from Windows 98 but it has been historically plagued with programming errors which may be frustrating for home users.</li>
<li><strong>Windows 98</strong> &ndash; This was produced in two main versions. The first Windows 98 version was plagued with programming errors but the windows 98 second edition which came out later was much better with many errors resolved.</li>
<li><strong>Windows NT</strong> &ndash; A version of windows made specifically for businesses offering better control over workstation capabilities to help network administrators.</li>
<li><strong>Windows 95</strong> &ndash; The first version of windows after the older windows 3.x versions offering a better library functions for programs.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are other worthwhile types of operating systems not made by Microsoft. The greatest problem with these operating systems lies in the fact that not as many application programs are written for them. However, you can get the type of application programs you are looking for.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>UNIX</strong> &ndash; A system that has been around for many years and it is very stable. It is primarily used to be a server rather than a workstation and should not be used by anyone who does not understand the system. It can be difficult to learn. UNIX must normally run on a computer made by the same company that produces the software.</li>
<li><strong>Linux</strong> &ndash; Linux is similar to UNIX in operation but it is free. It also should not be used by anyone who does not understand the system and can be difficult to learn.</li>
<li><strong>Apple Macintosh</strong> &ndash; Most recent versions are based on UNIX but it has a good graphical interface so it is both stable (does not crash) and easy to learn. One drawback to this system is that it can only be run on Apple hardware.</li>

<h2>TOPIC 13: Human Trafficking</h2>
<p>Human trafficking is the sale, transport and profit from human beings who are forced to work for others. This business is tantamount to slavery. Against their will, millions of people around the world are forced to work for the profit of others. Trafficking in persons is a serious crime and gross violation of human rights. Every year, thousands of men women and children fall into the hand of traffickers in their own countries and abroad. These unfortunate human beings are subjected to prostitution, begging, working in sweatshops and other forms of dehumanizing activities.</p>
<h3>How Does Trafficking Happen</h3>
<p>Young women are usually fascinated when they are promised a good job with a fat pay packet. In most cases, they use force, threat, coercion, abduction, fraud and deception. On arrival at their destination, their passports, visas and return tickets are taken from them and they are forced to do any manner of work they are asked to do. Even the money they earn is not given to them.</p>

<p><strong>TOPIC 28: INTERNET</strong></p>
<p>Internet is defined as a means of connecting a computer to any other computer anywhere in the world via dedicated routers and servers. When two computers are connected over the internet, they can send and receive all kinds of information such as text, graphics, voice, video and computer programs. No one owns the internet although several organizations in the world collaborate in its functioning and development. The high speed fiber optic cables through which the bulk of the internet data travels are owned by smartphone companies in their respective countries.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The internet grew out of the Advanced Research projects Agency&rsquo;s Wide Area Network (ARPANET) established by the US Department of Defense in the 1960s for collaboration in military research among business and government laboratories. Later universities and other US institutions connected to it. This resulted in ARPANET growing beyond everyone&rsquo;s expectations and acquiring the name &lsquo;Internet.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The development of hypertext based technology called World Wide Web provided means of displaying text, graphics and animations. A website address also known as a URL (uniform resource locator) is an internet or intranet name that points to a location where a file, directory or website page is hosted. Website addresses can represent the homepage of a web site, a script, image, photo, movie or other file made available on a server for viewing, processing or download. They can also be embedded into the code of web pages in the form of hyperlinks to direct the user to other locations on the internet.</p>
<p>A web browser is a software application for retrieving, presenting and traversing information resources on the World Wide Web. An information resource is identified by a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI/URL) and may be a web page, image, video or other piece of content. Hyperlinks present in resources enable users easily to navigate their browsers to related resources. Although browsers are primarily intended to use the World Wide Web, they can also be used to access information provided by web servers in private networks or files in file systems.</p>
<p>The primary purpose of a web browser is to bring information resources to the user allowing them to view the information and then access other information. Available web browsers range in features from minimal, text-based user interfaces with bare-bones support for HTML to rich user interfaces supporting a wide variety of file formats and protocols. Bowsers which include additional components are referred to as internet suites rather than merely web browsers. All major web browsers allow the user to open multiple information resources at the same time, either in different browser windows or in different tabs of the same window.</p>

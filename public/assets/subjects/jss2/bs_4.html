<h2>TOPIC 4: TYPES OF ENERGY</h2>
<h3>Kinetic Theory Assumptions</h3>
<p>Matter is defined as anything that has mass and can occupy space. Matter exists in three different states &ndash; solid, liquid and gas. The idea of kinetic theory is that matter is made up of tiny particles which are in motion. These particles possess kinetic energy. As the particles continue to bombard the surfaces, they exert pressure on them. The kinetic theory is derived from particulate theory of matter which states:</p>
<ul>
<li>All matter is made up of atoms and molecules</li>
<li>These particles called molecules are in a constant state of motion</li>
<li>Because they are in motion, they possess kinetic energy</li>
<li>The particles exert attractive forces on one another</li>
<li>The nearer the particles are to each other, the greater the attractive force.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Molecular Structure of Matter</h3>
<p>Matter exists in three states (forms) namely: solid, liquid and gas. It is made up of atoms and molecules. These molecules of matter are always in motion. The arrangement of these particles depends on the force of attraction existing between them. This makes them to exist in three states &ndash; solid, liquid and gas.</p>
<h4>Properties of Solids</h4>
<ul>
<li>Solid particles are arranged in regular patterns with strong intermolecular bonds</li>
<li>They are normally hard and rigid</li>
<li>They have fixed shapes and volumes</li>
<li>They are not easily squeezed into smaller sizes</li>
<li>Particles of solids shake when heat is supplied and intermolecular spaces are created. As more heat is supplied, the solid structure breaks down, expands and melts. During the process of cooling they revert to solid state. This is also known as freezing. The temperature at which solid changes into liquid form or melts is known as melting point. A solid can change directly into gaseous state without first changing into liquid form. This phenomenon is called sublimation.</li>
<li>Solids have high density compared to that of liquid.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Properties of Liquids</h4>
<ul>
<li>Liquid particles are loosely arranged with small intermolecular spaces</li>
<li>They are held by weak intermolecular bonds which bind they together in clusters</li>
<li>They have no fixed shape but take the shape of their container</li>
<li>Liquids have fixed volume and is incompressible</li>
<li>When heat is supplied to a liquid, it expands by boiling when it reaches a temperature known as boiling point</li>
<li>Liquids have high density compared to that of gas.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Properties of Gas</h4>
<ul>
<li>Gas particles are very loosely arranged with much intermolecular space</li>
<li>The intermolecular bond between gas molecules is very weak (almost negligible)</li>
<li>Particles of Gases move more randomly colliding with one another and the walls of their container causing pressure</li>
<li>They have no fixed shapes or volumes</li>
<li>They can be compressed</li>
<li>When heat is supplied to gas molecules it expands by travelling further away</li>
<li>It has low density compared to that of solid and liquid.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Basic Assumptions of Kinetic Theory</h3>
<p>The assumptions of the kinetic theory of gases include</p>
<ul>
<li>Gases are made up of molecules which are always in motion and possess kinetic energy</li>
<li>During the motion, the molecules collide with one another and hit the walls of the container thereby exerting pressure on it</li>
<li>The collision between the molecules is perfectly elastic</li>
<li>The forces of attraction and repulsion between the molecules of the gas are very small</li>
<li>The temperature of the gas increases as the average kinetic energy of the gas molecules increases.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also note the following.</p>
<ul>
<li>Boiling is the changing of any liquid into gaseous form by heating it to a specific temperature.</li>
<li>Evaporation is the changing of liquid into vapor or gaseous form without direct heating</li>
<li>Freezing is the change of a liquid into a solid form as a result of extreme cooling</li>
<li>Condensation is the process by which a gas changes into a liquid form as a result of cooling.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Factors Affecting Rate of Evaporation of a Liquid</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Temperature:</strong> The rate of evaporation increases with increase in temperature</li>
<li><strong>Pressure:</strong> The rate of evaporation decreases with increase in pressure</li>
<li><strong>Area of liquid surface exposed:</strong> The more the surface area of a liquid exposed, the more rapid evaporation will be</li>
<li><strong>Nature of a liquid:</strong> Liquids evaporate at various rates, the lower the boiling point of a liquid, the more the rate of evaporation</li>
<li><strong>Wind and dryness of air:</strong> The dryness of air in the atmosphere causes rapid evaporation of water from the wet material.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Similarities between Boiling and Evaporation</h3>
<ul>
<li>Both of them involve escape of molecules into the atmosphere</li>
<li>They both depend on the nature of liquid</li>
<li>They both depend on pressure</li>
<li>Both of them depend on the area of surface exposed.</li>

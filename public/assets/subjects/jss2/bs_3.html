<h2>TOPIC 3: WORK, ENERGY AND POWER</h2>
<h4>Work</h4>
<p>Work is said to be done whenever a force moves a body or object through a certain distance in the direction of the force. Work is associated with motion (movement). If any force remains in a point even for a period of time, work is not done. Work is said to be done if the force moves and causes displacement in the direction of the force. For example, work is done when a lump of stone is moves over a certain distance or when a vehicle moves a certain distance with bags of rice packed in it. In these examples, the amount of work done is the product of the force used and the distance covered in the direction of the force.</p>
<p>Mathematically, Work (W) = Force (F) x Distance (S) in the direction of the force.</p>
<p>The S.I. unit of work is the Joule (J). One joule is the work done when a force of one newton (1N) moves a distance of one meter (1m). Force is that which changes the body&rsquo;s state of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line.</p>
<p>Mathematically, Force (F) = Mass (m) x Acceleration (a). Therefore F = ma.</p>
<h5>Calculations</h5>
<h6>Example 1:</h6>
<p>Calculate the work done when a force of 5N moves through a distance of 5m in the direction of the force.</p>
<p><strong><u>Solution</u></strong></p>
<p>Work done = Force x Distance</p>
<p>Force = 5N, Distance = 5m</p>
<p>Work done = 5 x 5</p>
<p>Work done = 25 Joules or 25J</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6>Example 2:</h6>
<p>Calculate the work done when a force of 50N travels through a distance of 10m.</p>
<p><strong><u>Solution</u></strong></p>
<p>Work done = Force x Distance</p>
<p>Force = 50N, Distance = 10m</p>
<p>Work done = 50 x 10</p>
<p>Work done = 500J</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6>Example 3:</h6>
<p>Calculate the work done when a bag of cement of 50kg is lifted through a vertical height of 4m (g = 10m/s<sup>2</sup>).</p>
<p><strong><u>Solution</u></strong></p>
<p>Work done = Force x Distance</p>
<p>But Force = Mass (m) x Acceleration (a). In this case a = g (acceleration due to gravity).</p>
<p>Mass (m) = 50kg, Acceleration (a) = 10m/s<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>Therefore Force = 50 x 10 = 500N</p>
<p>Work done = 500 x 4</p>
<p>Work done = 2000J</p>
<h3>Energy</h3>
<p>Energy can be defined as the capacity or ability to perform work. The amount of work done by a system is a measure of the used energy. The relationship between energy and work is that energy enables work to be done and as work is done, energy is used up. Since the quantity of work done is a measure of the energy used up, both work and energy have the same unit of measurement. The S.I. unit is the Joule (J).</p>
<p>There are various forms of energy such as kinetic energy, chemical energy, heat energy, electrical energy, light energy, sound energy nuclear energy and potential energy. All the forms of energy can be changed from one form to another by means of suitable machines or apparatus. For example</p>
<ul>
<li>An electric iron converts electrical energy to heat energy</li>
<li>An electric fan converts electrical energy to mechanical energy</li>
<li>Heat engines convert heat energy into mechanical energy and so on.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Law of Conservation of Energy</h4>
<p>The law of conservation of energy states that although energy can be changed from one form to another, the total energy of a given system remains unchanged i.e. energy can neither be created nor destroyed during a transformation. The above law remains true except in atomic and nuclear reactions. In order to measure the quantity of energy used up in the process of doing work, only potential and kinetic energy will be discussed.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h5>Potential Energy</h5>
<p>This is the energy a body possesses because of its position. This is the energy stored up in a body at rest. A body that is in position from which it can do or perform work is said to have potential energy. Examples are a stretched catapult, a compressed spring and an orange fruit hanging on a tree. These all have potentials to do work. At the start of doing work, the potential energy is converted to kinetic energy and other forms of energy. The S.I. unit of potential energy is Joule (J).</p>
<p>Mathematically, P.E. = mgh</p>
<p>Where m = mass of the body or object measured in kilogram, g = acceleration due to gravity and h = height of the body or object above the ground.</p>
<h6>Types of Potential Energy</h6>
<ul>
<li>Gravitational Potential Energy: It is the work done when a body of mass (m) falls a vertical distance (h) under gravity.</li>
<li>Elastic Potential Energy: If a spiral spring is stretched over a distance (h), the energy acquired is referred to as elastic potential energy.</li>
</ul>
<p>Calculations</p>
<p>Example 1:</p>
<p>A fall is 50m high, calculate the potential energy of 5kg of water at the top of the fall (g = 10m/s<sup>2</sup>).</p>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>Potential Energy (P.E) = mgh</p>
<p>Potential Energy (P.E) = 5 x 10 x 50</p>
<p>Potential Energy (P.E) = 2500J</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Example 2:</p>
<p>Calculate the potential energy of a 15kg bunch of palm fruit hanging at the top of the palm tree 20m high (g = 10m/s<sup>2</sup>).</p>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>Potential Energy (P.E) = mgh</p>
<p>Potential Energy (P.E) = 15 x 10 x 20</p>
<p>Potential Energy (P.E) = 3000J</p>
<h5>Kinetic Energy</h5>
<p>This is the energy a body possesses because it is in motion. This is the type of energy that is used in doing work. Examples are the energy possessed by a moving vehicle, a moving bullet and so on. As the work is done, the kinetic energy is converted into other forms of energy. Both potential and kinetic energy are referred to as mechanical energy.</p>
<p>Mathematically, Kinetic Energy (K.E) = &frac12; mv<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p>Where m = the mass of the body and v = the speed (velocity) of the moving body.</p>
<p>Calculations</p>
<p>Example 1:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Calculate the kinetic energy of a body of mass 40kg running with an average speed of 10m/s.</p>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>Kinetic Energy (K.E) = &frac12; mv<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>Kinetic Energy (K.E) = &frac12; x 40 x 10<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>Kinetic Energy (K.E) = 20 x 100</p>
<p>Kinetic Energy (K.E) = 2000J</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Example 2:</p>
<p>A man of mass 40kg is moving with a constant velocity. If the kinetic energy is 400J, find the velocity of the man.</p>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>Kinetic Energy (K.E) = &frac12; mv<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>4000 = &frac12; x 40 x v<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>4000 = 20 x v<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;${{v}^{2}}=~\frac{4000}{20}$</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ${{v}^{2}}=200$</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
$v=\sqrt{200}$</p>
<p>&nbsp;= 14.14m/s</p>
<h3>Power</h3>
<p>This is defined as the rate of doing work or the rate of transfer of energy with time. Power is therefore related to energy and work. The S.I. unit of power is the Watt (W).</p>
<p>Mathematically, Power (P) = $\frac{Work~or~energy~expended}{Time~taken}$.</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Calculations</p>
<p>Example 1:</p>
<p>A vehicle travelling at a constant speed of 20m/s overcomes a constant frictional resistance of 300N. Calculate the average power of the engine.</p>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>Power of the engine = $\frac{Force~used~&nbsp; \times ~ distance }{Time~}$</p>
<p>elocity = distance/time. Therefore power = force x velocity</p>
<p>Power of the engine = 300 x 20 = 6000W</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Example 2:</p>
<p>Calculate the power of a pump which lifts 500kg of water through a vertical height of 4m in 5s. (g = 10m/s<sup>2</sup>).</p>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>Power = &nbsp;$\frac{Force~used~&nbsp; \times ~ distance }{Time~}$</p>
<p>Force = mass x acceleration = 500 x 10 = 5000N.</p>
<p>Power = $\frac{5000~\times~4}{5}$ &nbsp;= 4000W</p>

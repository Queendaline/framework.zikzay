<h2><strong>TOPIC 17: ACCIDENTS</strong></h2>
<p>Domestic accidents are those accidents that occur in the home. They include cuts, fire outbreak, falls, drug abuse, burns, electric shock and intake of poisonous substances.</p>
<h3>Cuts</h3>
<p>Cuts are open wounds that bleed easily. They can be caused by any sharp object.</p>
<h4>First Aid for Cuts:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Apply pressure on the affected region to stop the bleeding</li>
<li>Wash the surrounding skin with clean and sterilized water</li>
<li>Take the victim to the doctor if the cut is big and hemorrhage cannot be controlled</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fire Outbreak</h3>
<p>Fire Outbreak in the home is usually caused by a lot of factors including wrong electrical wiring, faulty electrical appliances, gas leakage, and carelessness around fuel.</p>
<h4>Prevention of Fire Outbreak</h4>
<ul>
<li>The Gas cooker should always be turned off after use</li>
<li>All electrical appliances should be turned off as soon as they are no longer in use</li>
<li>When using candle light, Support the candle on a flat plate that will not melt easily. Never place your candle on a rug or carpet. Blow out the light as soon as you want to go to bed.</li>
<li>Always use a generator in an open place outside the house. Avoid inhaling the carbon monoxide from the generator</li>
<li>When wiring a house, it is important to engage the services of a professional engineer. Conduit wiring is safer than surface wiring.</li>
</ul>
<p>Victims of fire outbreak are treated as those with burns. Burns are in degrees. In the case of slight burn (1<sup>st</sup> or 2<sup>nd</sup> degree) follow this first aid directive:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep in cold water for about 10-15 minutes.</li>
<li>Apply sterile gauze (bandage)</li>
<li>Send victim to the doctor.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Falls</h3>
<p>A fall means dropping from a higher position to a lower position. In the home this could be caused by tripping over objects, slipping over slippery surfaces or any other accident. A fall can result in a cut, fracture, dislocation, wound and so on.</p>

<h3>Drug Abuse and Consumption of Harmful (Poisonous) Substances</h3>
<p>When such substances are taken in large quantities, there is usually general weakness of the body. The safest thing to do is to take the victim to the doctor who will determine the type of drug that will neutralize the effect of the substance taken.</p>
<h3>Electric Shock</h3>
<p>This happens when someone touches a live wire mistakenly. This may result in stoppage of respiration. When this happens, artificial respiration is needed to keep the victim alive.</p>

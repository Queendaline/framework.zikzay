<h3>TOPIC 25: COMPUTER ETHICS</h3>
<h3>Responsible Use of Computer and Internet</h3>
<p>A computer is a handy tool for many school assignments. To that end, the following sections focus on some ways you can use a computer for writing, doing research, communicating with other students, calculating numeric data, creating charts or graphs, taking digital pictures, shooting videos, and getting extra help.</p>
<h3>Writing</h3>
<p>One of the most common ways people use a computer is as a replacement for the old-fashioned typewriter or pen and paper. You can use your computer as a word processing program such as Word, to type it.</p>
<h3>Benefits of Using a Word Processing Program</h3>
<ul>
<li>Mistakes can easily be corrected</li>
<li>The contents of the writing can easily be reorganized</li>
<li>Spelling and grammar mistakes can easily be checked and corrected</li>
</ul>
<h3>Keeping the Computer Clean</h3>
<p>When dealing with computers, dust isn&rsquo;t just unattractive, it can potentially destroy parts of your computer. By cleaning your computer regularly, you can help to keep it working properly and avoid expensive repairs. The following steps might be useful in keeping the computer system clean.</p>
<ul>
<li>Before cleaning, always ensure that the computer is turned off and isn&rsquo;t plugged to any power supply.</li>
<li>Use a can of compressed air to clean hard to reach areas of the computer such as in between keys of the keyboard.</li>
<li>Use a moist cloth to clean surfaces but be careful not to pour any liquid directly into or unto the computer system.</li>
</ul>
<p>If liquid is spilled accidentally on the keyboard or any part of the computer, quickly shut down the computer, disconnect it from any power source it might be connected to and turn it upside down to allow the liquid to drain. The best way to avoid this situation is to keep drinks and all liquid substances away from the computer system.</p>
<h3>Using Dust Cover</h3>
<p>Computer dust covers will not only serve as a PC filter but also as a protector of your hard work and investment. Computer dust cover will protect your computer from dust and harmful particles that can cause overheating and result in greater problems later on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Protection From Power Problems</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sags</strong>: Sags are short-term decreases in voltage levels. This is the most common power problem. Sags are usually caused by the start-up power demands of many electrical devices. Electric companies use sags to cope with extraordinary power demands. A sag can starve a computer of the power it needs to function and cause frozen keyboards and unexpected system crashes which results in both lost or corrupted data. Sags also reduce the efficiency and life span of electrical equipment, particularly motors.</li>
<li><strong>Blackout</strong>: This is the total loss of utility power. Blackouts are caused by excessive demand on the power grid, lightning storms, ice on power lines, earthquakes and other catastrophes. This causes the current work in the RAM and cache is lost. The hard drive file allocation table (FAT) may also be lost which results in total loss of data stored on drive.</li>
<li><strong>Spikes and Surges: </strong>Also referred to as an impulse, spikes are instantaneous, dramatic increases in voltage. They are typically caused by lightning strikes and can cause catastrophic damage to hardware.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Protecting Your Computers and Data</h3>
<p>Our computers need to be protected from theft, fraud, harmful content and provided with steady &ldquo;clean&rdquo; power that does not sag, spike or blackout. We must therefore identify and decide what level of protection our computer systems require.</p>
<ul>
<li>Connect all electronic equipment to uninterruptible power supply to protect them from electric surges and spikes.</li>
<li>Unplug your system when not in use for long.</li>
<li>Avoid connecting devices that may have virus to your computer system.</li>
<li>Protect your passwords and personal data from unauthorized personnel using firewall and other security software</li>
<li>Avoid visiting untrusted and intrusive sites that may steal your personal data.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Ways of Misusing the Internet</h3>
<p>The internet has been a blessing to humanity. It has made life easier and helped technology improve. We rely on the internet for a lot of relevant and reliable information that we use for school work, research and so on. But the internet also has disadvantages too. No invention of man can be perfect. Though the advantages of using the internet are numerous, we cannot ignore the disadvantages.</p>
<ul>
<li>Electronic Spam &ndash; This is electronic junk that is usually unwanted and sent in large quantities to numerous recipients. A major negative effect of electronic spam is that it uses up a lot of bandwidth and it may include malware.</li>
<li>The internet also contains negative, disturbing and harmful content accessible to everyone using it. Most of the time, these can appear as intrusive ads that divert your attention from the work you intended to use the internet for.</li>
<li>A lot of other evil vices take place on the internet such as hacking, identity theft, false information and pornography.</li>
</ul>

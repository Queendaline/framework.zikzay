<h2>TOPIC 11: BASIC HUMAN MOVEMENT</h2>
<h3>Posture and Postural Defects</h3>
<p>Posture is the position the body assumes for a specified movement. It shows proper alignment of body parts when one is working, running, standing and so on. There are good and bad postures.</p>
<p>Good Posture: This simply means the position that requires the least muscular work to bring about movement with grace and poise.</p>
<p>Bad Posture: Bad posture is the posture that puts strain on the muscles, ligaments and bones. Poor posture puts abnormal strain on bones which may lead to deformities referred to as postural defects.</p>
<h4>Postural Defects</h4>
<p>Postural defects occur as a result of non-alignment of body parts, that is, when more pressure is on a part of the body than the others. That is to say that there is no grace and poise in one&rsquo;s movement. There are many postural defects. However, it is important to note that there are true postural problems and there are apparent ones which are as a result of manifestation of growth stage. In the early stages of life, even up to the age of ten years, a child could manifest protruding stomach, knock knees and so on. But as he grows, these manifestations disappear. Other common postural defects include uneven shoulders, lateral curvature (scoliosis), cervical lordosis, hunch back, and lumber lordosis and so on.</p>
<h4>Causes of Postural Problems</h4>
<p>Postural problems, whether true or apparent, are caused by underlying defect of skeletal development or injuries as a result of accident. Sometimes, it results from body muscle imbalance or weakness. Other causes include mental depression, anxiety, poorly fitted shoe, poor nutrition, accident, occupation, fatigue, imitating adults and lack of exercise.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mental Depression: When people are mentally depressed, their head drop deep in thought. When this continues for a long time there is bound to be a postural problem</li>
<li>Poorly Fitted Shoes: Tightly fitted shoes or oversized shoes will always cause pains to the toes resulting in abnormal movement. This could easily be corrected by wearing well fitted shoes</li>
<li>Poor Nutrition: Good and well-balanced diet is very important for proper development of muscles and bones. Food rich in calcium such as milk are required for proper formation and development of bones and muscles in particular</li>
<li>Accident: Accident is an unexpected mishap. It can happen anytime and anywhere. When it happens, people will be maimed in one way or the other. Some may lose their limbs, the vertebrae column may be affected, and even the hip bone may also be affected leading to one postural problem or the other</li>
<li>Occupation: One&rsquo;s occupation may affect his/her posture. For instance, someone who is always writing is bound to suffer cervical lordosis &ndash; head projected forward or round shoulder</li>
<li>Fatigue: Fatigue means extreme tiredness or exhaustion. It is a temporary inability of the muscular system to perform efficiently. There are different types of fatigue: Physical fatigue and mental fatigue. However, we are only concerned about the physical fatigue as it could cause postural defect. When exhausted, the affected person cannot stand or sit in a good posture. If this continues for a long time, his/her vertebral column could become bent</li>
<li>Imitating Adult: Some children are in the habit of imitating their adult role models in the way they speak, dress, move, sit, run and carry their shoulders. Eventually they end up with an abnormal posture</li>
<li>Lack of Exercise: Lack of exercise can result in any part of the body to be atrophied or weakened resulting in pressure and more work load on other parts of the body. This eventually affects the graceful movement and posture of the individual.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Explanation of Some Postural Defects as a result of Spine Deformities</h4>
<ul>
<li>Kyphosis &ndash; Hunchback or Round back: Kyphosis is a spinal curvature in which a large round shape also called the hump at the upper back is prominent. It is also called thoracic hypnosis. This causes the upper vertebrae and the shoulders to tilt forward.</li>
<li>Scoliosis (Lateral Curvature): Scoliosis is a lateral curvature of the spine. Here, the curvature is side to side with one shoulder lowered below the level of the other.</li>
<li>Lumbar Lordosis or Hollow back: Lumbar lordosis is a postural condition in which the lower back sways in causing the stomach to protrude resulting in a hollow at the lumbar region.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Preventive/Corrective Measures</h4>
<p>No person is ever happy with any part of his/her body deformed be it natural or by accident. To avoid such defects, the following must be adhered to.</p>
<ul>
<li>Well Planned exercises e.g. sit up, push up, rope climbing, cycling and so on</li>
<li>Well balanced diet rich in calcium and other minerals</li>
<li>Children should be taught the proper way of standing, walking and sitting</li>
<li>Avoid anxiety and depression</li>
<li>Avoid fatigue, however, if it is unavoidable as a result of one&rsquo;s occupation, endeavor to have enough rest after the day&rsquo;s work</li>
<li>Observe break period always.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Importance of Good Posture</h4>
<p>The importance of proper posture cannot be overemphasized. They include;</p>
<ul>
<li>It is necessary for optimal functioning of the different parts of the body</li>
<li>It gives self-confidence and optimism</li>
<li>Enjoyment of good health depends largely on good posture.</li>

<h2>TOPIC 26: SAFETY MEASURES WHEN USING THE COMPUTER</h2>
<p>Computers have become part of our daily life and there are different safety measures to be followed while working on them apart from proper posture and placement of the device. This not only helps to avoid electric shocks but also helps to keep your stored data and system safe.</p>
<ul>
<li>Liquids and electronics do not mix and a spill on your keyboard or other electronic equipment can be hazardous. Not only can such a spill cause sparking and shock, but sills can severely damage delicate electronics. To avoid spills, keep all drinks away from electronic if possible and always use sturdy cups with lids to minimize any accidents. Try to avoid the habit of drinking water, tea, coffee, etc. while working on a computer desk. Wipe your hands before you operate any computer or electronic device. Do not place your computer close to places where there is moisture.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Sitting Posture</strong></p>
<p>Before starting work, make sure to check your position with the computer. Frequent posture changes is effective in reducing stress on the body and redistributing pressure caused by long lengths of working in a stationary or static position.</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep the monitor in front of you so that your neck is aligned straight. Do not turn your neck to the side to work</li>
<li>The screen should be set so you don&rsquo;t bend your neck up or down to view the screen</li>
<li>The monitor should be 16-30 inches or an arm&rsquo;s length away</li>
<li>Place frequent used items within arm&rsquo;s reach to avoid over stretching</li>
<li>Place the feet flat on the floor or on a footrest</li>
<li>Adjust your chair to provide good back support</li>
<li>Set the back tilt to a slightly reclined position of 100-110˚</li>
<li>The height of the keyboard and pointing device should be low enough so your arms are relaxed at your sides</li>
<li>The keyboard should be wide enough to include the mouse or pointing device</li>
<li>The wrist or palm rest should be as wide as the usable portions of the keyboard and should match the shape and height of the keyboard. The palm rest supports the heel of the hand and decreased hand contact with the table edges</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Upright Sitting Posture</strong>: The user&rsquo;s torso and neck are approximately vertical and in-line. The thighs are approximately horizontal and the lower legs are vertical.</p>
<p><strong>Standing Posture</strong>: The user&rsquo;s legs, torso, neck and head are approximately in-line and vertical. The user may also elevate one foot on a rest while in this posture.</p>
<p><strong>Inclined Sitting Posture</strong>: The user&rsquo;s thighs are inclined with the buttocks higher than the knee. The angle between the thigh and torso is greater than 90˚. The torso is vertical or slightly reclined and the legs are vertical</p>
<p><strong>Reclined Sitting Posture</strong>: The user&rsquo;s torso and neck are straight and reclined between 100 and 120˚ from the thighs.</p>
<p><strong>Posture Variations</strong>: There is no single &ldquo;correct&rdquo; posture. There are many variations of neutral posture and depending on what tasks you have to perform and the furniture in your workstation; you may find one of these alternatives to be more comfortable to you. These variations are useful when changing postures throughout the day.</p>
<p><strong>90 Degree Posture</strong>: Sit upright with your elbows, hips and knees bent at right angles and your feet flat on the floor or on a footrest. This position is biochemically correct but it can stress your back muscles over time.</p>
<p><strong>Reclining Posture</strong>: Lean back into the chair&rsquo;s backrest and put your feet out in front of you to open up the angle at your hips and knees. This helps relax your back muscles and promotes blood circulation. Leaning back too far can result in an awkward neck posture when trying to keep your head upright.</p>
<p><strong>Forward Tilt Posture</strong>: Raise the height of your chair&rsquo;s seat a few inches and tilt the front of it downward about 8˚. This will open up your hip angle and allow you to support some of your weight using your legs rather than having it all rest on your hips and the backs of your thighs. You may not find this posture comfortable if you have knee or foot problems or if you feel like you are sliding off the seat. A contoured chair/seat can help to hold you in place.</p>
<p><strong>Standing Posture</strong>: Standing provides the biggest change in posture and is a good alternative to prolonged sitting which can aggravate low back injuries. It can be fatiguing however, so have a counter height chair available at standing workstations. Also prop one foot up on a low foot rest occasionally to help shift your weight.</p>
<p><strong>Monitor Positioning</strong></p>
<p><strong>Angle: </strong>Place the monitor directly in front of you and facing you not angled to the left or right. This helps to eliminate too much neck twisting. Also, whatever the user i9s working with, encourage him/her to use the screen scroll so that whatever is being viewed is at the center of the monitor not at the top or bottom of the screen.</p>
<p><strong>Centering: </strong>Center the monitor on the user so that the body and/or neck are not twisted when looking at the screen.</p>
<p><strong>Height: </strong>Ensure that the monitor at a confortable height that does not make the user tilt their head up or down to see what is on the screen. If the monitor is too low the user will have to adjust his/her neck forwards, if it is too high, they&rsquo;ll tilt their head backwards and end up with neck/shoulder pain.</p>
<p><strong>Viewing Distance:</strong> The monitor should be at a comfortable horizontal distance for viewing which is around an arm&rsquo;s length. At this distance, you should be able to see the viewing area of the monitor without moving your head.</p>
<p><strong>Screen Quality</strong>: Use a good quality computer screen. Make sure that the text characters on your screen looks sharp and that they are a comfortable size. You can change the resolution to find a comfortable and clear character size.</p>
<p><strong>Eye Health</strong>: There are natural changes in vision that occur in most people during their early 40s. It is a good idea to periodically have your eyes checked by a qualified professional. If any screen adjustments feel uncomfortable, change them until the arrangement feels more comfortable or seek further professional help.</p>

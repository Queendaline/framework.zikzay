<h2>TOPIC 27: BASIC KNOWLEDGE OF INFORMATION TECHNOGY</h2>
<p>ICT (Information and Communications Technology) is an umbrella term that includes any communication device or application encompassing radio, television, cellular phones, computer and network hardware and software, satellite systems and so on, as well as the various services and applications associated with them such as videoconferencing and distance learning. According to the European Commission, the importance of ICT lies more in its ability to create greater access to information and communication in underserved populations. Many countries around the world have established organizations for the promotion of ICT. Examples of Information and Communication Technology are the Computer, Telephone, Cellular Network, Satellite Communication, Television, Internet, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Benefits of Information Technology</strong></p>
<p>In general, IT has brought about significant improvements in business operations and in the entire human life as whole.</p>
<p>Talking about globalization, I.T. has not only brought the world closer together, but it has allowed the world&rsquo;s economy to become a single independent system. This means that we can not only share information quickly and efficiently, but we can also bring down barriers of linguistic and geographical boundaries. The world has developed into a global village due to the help of information technology allowing countries who are not only separated by distance but also by language to share ideas and information with each other.</p>
<p>In communication, I.T. has helped to make communication cheaper, quicker and more efficient. We can now communicate with anyone around the world by simply texting or emailing them for an almost instantaneous response. The internet has also opened up face to face direct communication from different parts of the world thanks to the help of video conferencing.</p>
<p>In terms of functionality and flexibility, internet I.T. can help improve infrastructure performance thus increasing functionality and the range of options that can br pursued. Externally, it can help create an efficient, flexible online/offline platform for doing business with customers, suppliers and partners.</p>

<li><strong>Communication:</strong>
<ol>
<li>Rapid communications can help increase productivity, allow for better business decision making and ease a company&rsquo;s expansion into new territories or countries. Email servers, routers, internal company billboards and chat services can serve as the backbone of a company&rsquo;s communications. These electronically based communication systems are used to disseminate routine and critical business information in a quick and efficient manner. I.T. equipment can be used to send business status reports to executives to update employees on critical business projects and to connect with business partners and customers.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Efficiency:</strong>
<ol>
<li>Streamlined work flow systems, shared storage and collaborative work spaces can increase efficiency in a business and allow employees to process a greater level of work in a shorter period of time. Information technology systems can be used to automate routine tasks, to make data analysis easier and to store data in a manner that can easily be retrieved for future use. Technology can also be used to answer customer questions through email or telephone routing system that connects a customer to an available customer service agent.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Competitive Advantage:</strong>
<ol>
<li>Adoption of information technology resources allows companies to maintain a competitive advantage over their rivals. Companies using a first-movers strategy can use information technology to create new products, distance their products from the existing market or enhance their customer services. Companies that follow a low-cost product strategy can look to information technology solutions to reduce their costs through increased productivity and reduced need for employee overhead. Businesses can also build-in information technology to their products that makes it difficult for customers to switch platforms or products.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Economic Efficiencies:</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Companies can harness information technology resources to lower their costs. Using I.T. infrastructure, redundant tasks can be centralized at one location. For example, a large company could centralize their payroll function at one location to lower employee costs. Economic efficiencies can also be realized by migrating high cost functions into an online environment. Companies can offer email support for customers that may have a lower cost than a live customer support call. Cost savings could also be found through outsourcing opportunities, remote work options and lower-cost communication options.</p>
<p><strong>The Disadvantage of Information Technology</strong></p>
<p>Advances in information technology changed the way business is conducted. Correspondence that once took weeks to get from one organization to another is now delivered instantly with the push of a button. Advances in telecommunication allow associates from all point of the globe to confer a virtual environment, minimizing the need for business travel. Although the benefits of integrating information technology in business are many, there are also disadvantages to its use.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Implementation Expenses:</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Every business must consider startup costs when implementing any type of information technology system. In addition to the cost of hardware and software, some technology vendors require businesses to purchase user licenses for each employee that will be operating the basic system. Businesses must examine the cost of training employees in unfamiliar technology. Although basic information technology systems may be user friendly, advanced programs still require formal instruction by an expert consultant</p>

<li><strong>Job Elimination</strong>:</li>
</ol>
<p>Implementing information technology to business operations can save a great deal of time during the completion of daily tasks. Paperwork is processed immediately and financial transactions are automatically calculated. As technology improves, tasks that were formerly performed by human employees are now carried out by computer systems. For example, Automated telephone answering systems have replaced live receptionists in many organizations. This leads to the elimination of jobs and in some cases, alienation of clients. Unemployed specialists and one-loyal employees may have difficulty securing future employment.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Security Breaches:</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The ability to store information in an electronic database facilitates quicker, more efficient communication. In the past, an individual would sift through stacks of paper records to retrieve data. With properly implemented technology, information can be recovered at the touch of a button. Although information technology systems allow businesses to be conducted at a faster pace, they are not without their flaws. Information technology systems are vulnerable to security breaches particularly when they are accessible via the internet. If appropriate measures are not in place, unauthorized individuals may access confidential data. Information may be altered, permanently destroyed or used for unsavory purposes.</p>
<p><strong>I.T. Gadgets</strong></p>
<p>The GSM (Global system for Mobile communication) is a mobile telephony system that is widely used in Europe and other parts of the world. GSM uses a variation of time division multiple access (TDMA) and is the most widely used of the three digital telephony technologies. GSM digitizes and compresses data then sends it down a channel with two other streams of user data each in its own time slot. It operates at either the 900MHZ or 1800MHZ frequency band. Mobile services based on GSM technology were first launched in Finland in1991. Today, more than 690 mobile networks provide GSM services across 213 countries and GSM represents 82.4% of all global GSM connections. According to GSM world, there are now more than 2 billion GSM mobile phone users worldwide and references China as the largest single GSM market with more than 370 million users followed by Russia with 145 million.</p>
<p>A fax (short for facsimile and sometimes called telecopying) is the telephonic transmission of scanned-in-printed material (text or images), usually to a telephone number associated with a printer or other output device. The original document is scanned with a fax machine which treats the contents as a single fixed graphic image converting it into a bitmap. In this digital form, the information is transmitted as electrical signals through the telephone system. The receiving fax machine reconverts the coded image and prints a paper copy of the document.</p>
<p>A telephone is a device that converts sound and electrical waves into audible relays and is used for communication. The telephone consists of two essential parts, a microphone and a speaker. This allows the user to speak into the device and also hear transmissions from the other user. The invention of the first telephones required an operator to connect calls are now connected automatically. Telephones formally utilized analog signals to transmit sounds but most calls are now placed over digital networks. Telephones are made in a variety of forms including a subset of the device called a cell phone or mobile phone also called phone</p>

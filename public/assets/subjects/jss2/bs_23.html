<h2>TOPIC 23: UNITS OF STORAGE IN COMPUTER</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Bit</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The smallest Unit of data in a computer is called the Bit (Binary Digit). A bit has a single binary value, either 0 or 1. In most computer systems, there are eight bits in a byte. The value of a bit is usually stored as either above or below a designated level of electrical charge in a single capacitor within a memory device. A bit is usually abbreviated as &ldquo;b&rdquo;.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Nibble</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Half a byte (four bits) is called a nibble.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Byte</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>In most computer systems, a byte is a unit of data that is eight binary digits long. A byte is the unit most computers use to represent a character such as a letter, number or typographic symbol. A byte can be a string of bits that need to be used in some larger unit of application purposes ( for example, the stream of bits that constitute a visual image for a program that displays images or the string of bits that constitutes the machine code of a computer program). In some computer systems, four bytes constitute a word, a unit that a computer processor can be designed to handle efficiently as it reads and processes each instruction. Some computer processors can handle two-byte or single-byte instructions. A byte is usually abbreviated as &ldquo;B&rdquo;. Computer storage is usually measured in byte multiples. For example, an 820 MB hard drive holds a nominal 820 million bytes or megabytes of data. Byte multiples are based on powers of two and commonly represented by a rounded off decimal number. For example one megabyte &ndash; one million bytes is actually 1,048,576 decimal bytes.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Octet</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>In some systems, the term octet is used for an eight-bit unit instead of byte. In many systems, four eight-bit bytes or octets form a 32-bit word. In such systems, instructions lengths are sometimes expressed as full-word (32 bits in length) or half-word (16 bits in length).</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Kilobyte</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>A kilobyte (kb) is approximately a thousand bytes (actually, 2 to the 10<sup>th</sup> power, or decimal 1,024 bytes).</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Megabyte</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The megabyte is a measure of computer processor storage and real and virtual memory. A megabyte (abbreviated MB) is 2 to the 20<sup>th</sup> power byte or 1,048,576 bytes in decimal notation.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Gigabyte</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>A gigabyte is a measure of computer data storage capacity and is roughly a billion bytes. A gigabyte is two to the 30<sup>th</sup> power or 1,073,741,824 in decimal notation.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Terabyte</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>A terabyte is a measure of computer storage capacity and is two to the 40<sup>th</sup> power bytes or 1,024 gigabytes</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Petabyte</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>A petabyte (PB) is a measure of memory or storage capacity and is two to the 50<sup>th</sup> power bytes or, in decimal, approximately a thousand terabytes (1,024 terabytes)</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Exabyte</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>An Exabyte (EB) is a large unit of computer data storage, two to the 60<sup>th</sup> power bytes. The prefix exa means one billion billion or one quintillion, which is a decimal term. In decimal terms, an Exabyte is a billion gigabytes.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Zettabyte</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>A Zettabyte (ZB) is equal to one sextillion bytes. It is commonly abbreviated ZB. At this time, no computer has one Zettabyte of storage. It has 1024 Exabytes.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Yottabyte</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>A yottabyte is equal to one septillion bytes. It is commonly abbreviated YB. At this time, no computer has one Yottabyte or storage. It has 1,024 Zettabytes.</p>

<p><strong>Difference between Kilobytes, Megabytes and Gigabytes</strong></p>
<p>The size of information in the computer is measured in kilobytes, megabytes and gigabytes. In this section, we&rsquo;ll look at common sizes you would see in real life.</p>
<p><strong>Kilobyte (KB)</strong></p>
<p>One kilobyte is a collection of about 1000 bytes. A page of ordinary roman alphabetic text takes 2 kb to store (about one byte per letter). A typical short email would also take up just 1 or 2 kb. Text is one of the most naturally compact types of data at about one byte required to store each letter.</p>
<p><strong>Megabyte (MB)</strong></p>
<p>One megabyte is about 1 million bytes. An mp3 audio file of a few minutes or a 10 million pixel image from a digital camera would typically take a few megabytes. A data CD disk stores about 700mb.</p>
<p><strong>Gigabyte (GB)</strong></p>
<p>One gigabyte is about 1 billion bytes or 1 thousand megabytes. A DVD movie is roughly 4-8 GB.</p>

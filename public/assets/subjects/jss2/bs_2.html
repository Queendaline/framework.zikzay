<h2>TOPIC 2: CHEMICALS</h2>
<p>A chemical can be defined as a substance having a specific molecular composition which is produced by or used in a chemical process. Alternatively, it can also be defined as any substance used in or resulting from a reaction involving changes in atoms or molecules especially one derived artificially for practical use. An example is sodium chloride (common salt) NaCl. Chemicals can be classified based on the use of the chemical and the hazardous nature of the chemical.</p>
<h3>Classification of Chemicals Based on the Use of the Chemical</h3>
<p>The various areas of use of chemicals are Pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, nuclear, agrochemical, industrial and laboratory chemicals.</p>
<h4>Pharmaceutical</h4>
<p>A pharmaceutical chemical is a substance used in preparing and dispensing drugs. In this industry, the purity of the chemical (drug) is of high importance and strict regulations are applied to control the manufacture and sale of the drug. Some pharmaceutical chemicals are inorganic compounds. Examples include potassium bromide used as a sedative, bismuthtrioxocarbonate (IV) used to cure stomach disorders, mercury (II) trioxonitrate (V) used as an antiseptic for skin diseases. The organic compounds may be specific drugs for certain diseases such as paludrine and plasmoquin which are anti-malarial drugs or analgesics (pain relievers) such as paracetamol and panadol or anesthetics such as chloroform and novacaine or antibiotics such as penicillin.</p>
<h4>Cosmetics</h4>
<p>The cosmetic industry uses thousands of synthetic chemicals in its products designed to beautify the body by direct application. Some of these cosmetics include shampoos, lipsticks, creams, lotions and perfumes. Some of the chemicals commonly found in cosmetics are phthalates, triclosan, 1,4-dioxane, parabens, ethylene oxide, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, placental extract, lead, aluminum and so on.</p>
<h4>Agrochemical</h4>
<p>This is a term used to refer to various chemical products used in agriculture such as fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides, fungicides and soil conditioners. They are applied to plants. Examples of fertilizers include aluminiumtrioxonitrate (V), ammoniumtetraoxosulphate (VI), urea and so on.</p>
<h4>Industrial Chemicals</h4>
<p>These chemicals can be used for different purposes in different industries and fields such as petrochemicals, construction, sewage treatment, desalination plants, oil and gas fields. Some examples of industrial chemicals are alcohols, acids, activated alumina, chlorides, carbonates, ethanol amines, oxides, sulphates, hydrocarbons and so on.</p>
<h4>Laboratory Chemicals</h4>
<p>A laboratory can be defined as a room or building equipped for scientific research, experimentation, teaching or for the manufacture of drugs and chemicals. Some common laboratory chemicals are mineral acids, bases, common organic acids, common acid-base indicators, flammable liquid and so on.</p>
<h3>Classification of Chemicals Based on Hazardous Nature</h3>
<p>Some chemicals are very dangerous when they make contact with the skin or poisonous when they get into the body. Therefore such chemicals must be handled carefully so that they do not harm us. Some are in aqueous solutions (liquids) while some are solids and yet others in gaseous (or vapor) form. Hazardous and toxic substances are defined as those chemicals present in the workplace which are capable of causing harm to people. These chemical substances could be classified in the following ways:</p>
<h4>Highly Hazardous and Toxic (Poisonous) Chemicals</h4>
<p>These include acids, alkalis, water reactive alkali metals, sulphides, metal salts, cyanides, organic substances, radioactive substances and so on.</p>
<h4>Moderately Hazardous and Toxic Chemicals</h4>
<p>Examples include hydrogen peroxide, propanone, trioxocarbonate (IV) acid, sodium trioxocarbonate (IV), and ammonia solution.</p>
<h4>Non-hazardous Chemicals</h4>
<p>Examples include water, buffer, ion resins, alumina, silica, sodium chloride, magnesiumtetraoxosulphate (VI) and calcium acetate.</p>
<h3>Further Classification of Chemicals</h3>
<p>Chemicals could also be further classified as fine chemicals and heavy chemicals.</p>
<h4>Fine Chemicals</h4>
<p>These are chemicals manufactured in relatively small quantities for specific use. They have high degree of purity and are expensive. Examples are dyes, perfumes, drugs, photographic materials, analytical chemicals and additives for paints and fuels.</p>
<h4>Heavy Chemicals</h4>
<p>These are essential chemicals for all branches of industry such as glass, textile, soap, metals and paints. They are manufactured in great quantity with a relatively lower degree of purity than fine chemicals. Examples include tetraoxosulphate (VI) acid, lime, trioxonitrate (V) acid, bleaching powder, caustic potash, caustic soda and sodium trioxocarbonate (IV).</p>

<h3>Safety Measures When Using Chemicals</h3>
<p>Planning, handling and maintenance of storage areas are necessary to avoid material losses, accidents and disasters. Good housekeeping and other safety measures are essential and special attention should be paid to incompatible substances, suitable location of products and climatic conditions. The following safety measures should be taken when using chemicals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adhere to the manufacturer&rsquo;s safety instruction</li>
<li>Follow safety guidelines for chemical storage and handling</li>
<li>Observe and adhere to safety signs and instructions on chemical packages</li>
<li>Ensure proper labeling and storage of chemical</li>
<li>No container of chemicals should be handled without labels containing identification of content and other relevant information regarding handling and safety</li>
<li>Do not touch, taste, inhale, or allow them to spill on you</li>
<li>Always wear safety materials such as a nose mask, goggle, gloves, boots, laboratory aprons/coats, etc. when visiting the laboratory or handling chemicals.</li>

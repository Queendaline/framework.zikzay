<h2>TOPIC 12: ISSUES AND CHALLENGES IN PHYSICAL AND HEALTH EDUCATION</h2>
<p>Every profession in today&rsquo;s world is faced with challenges because of the fast changing world. Physical and health education is not left out. In the recent past, physical education and health had numerous challenges such as drug and alcohol abuse, discrimination against women, physically challenged, budget, challenge of leadership, creativity, challenge of mediocrity, challenges of improving the curriculum of physical and health education, racism, violence and emphasis on winning in youth sports.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Drug and Alcohol Abuse</strong>: The use of drugs and alcohol to enhance performance has been there. However, recent equipment that detects drug consumption, even if it was taken some days before the competition has been put in place to detect offenders. Taking drugs by youth and adults alike for personal aggrandizement is on the increase and it is not in the interest of the society. Such drugs include caffeine, tobacco, alcohol, cocaine, marijuana and so on. All hands should be on deck to stem this evil tide in our schools, at home and the society at large.</li>
<li><strong>Discrimination against Women</strong>: In the past, women were completely excluded in physical education and sports. Today, there are women professors in physical and health education. Women are there in sports participating in All Africa games, Olympic Games, Commonwealth games and so on.</li>
<li><strong>Physically Challenged</strong>: In the past, physically challenged individuals were not considered fit due to fear and failure. Recently, due to the efforts and concern of physical and health educators, physically challenged persons can participate in many sporting events. They now have their own type of Olympic Games known as Paralympics. This major breakthrough in physical education and sports takes place every four years like the main Olympic Games. It takes place immediately after the Olympic Games in the same venue.</li>
<li><strong>Budget</strong>: The budget of physical and health education and sports has always been looked down upon due to lack of interest of the government. Their lack of interest is in their perception that sports will not produce monetary gain. However, because of the exploits of some soccer players, basketball professionals, volleyball players, boxers, wrestlers, etc. and the presence of some broadminded leaders, the budget of physical and health education and sports has appreciated. Yet, a lot has to be done so as to provide facilities such as standard gymnasia, swimming pools, etc. in higher institutions where physical education is taught.</li>
<li><strong>Challenges of Leadership:</strong> For physical and health education to achieve its ultimate goal i.e. professionalization, the leaders must look for those who have interest and ability in the area. The interest of these fellows will be to develop physical and health education to a standard that coaches, whether soccer, football, basketball, volleyball, boxing, etc., will be specialists in health and physical education. This will help eliminate quacks. Many coaches are not physical educationists. They are there for money and so cannot move the profession forward because one cannot give what one does not have. However, physical and health educators are gradually taking over.</li>
<li><strong>Creativity</strong>: The need for creativity is a major challenge facing physical and health education today. Creativity here means discovery of something that is new. For instance the origination of volleyball by William Morgan in 1895 and the development of basketball by Naismith. Physical education has had very few exciting creative ideas in its history. This is the reason for physical educators to think and come up with vibrant and radical ideas that will help the area grow with the age. This will make physical education more relevant to the rapidly changing world.</li>
<li><strong>Challenge of Mediocrity</strong>: In the past, physical education and sports were regarded as all-comers areas. That is, any person who can play football, soccer, run along tracks and perform various other sports is regarded as a Physical educator. These days things are improving because leaders in physical and health education are now living up to their responsibility.</li>
<li><strong>Challenges of Improving the Curriculum of Physical and Health Education</strong>: Improving the curriculum of physical and health education is a major challenge. As a result, the curriculum remains unchanged for years which are things that shouldn&rsquo;t be happening.</li>
<li><strong>Violence</strong>: This is a behavior that is intended to hurt others physically. Sports violence can be seen as fracas amongst players in the field of play. If not checked may affect the spectators. A number of times, the fans have been seen to engage in fights when their favorite teams did not win. Violence is more prevalent in team sports such as American football, soccer, hockey, basketball, and so on.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Causes of Violence</h3>
<ul>
<li>A must win attitude on the part of the players, the coach and the fans</li>
<li>The officials &ndash; mainly the center referee and the assistant referees have decided to take sides with one of the teams. They usually close their eyes to the offences of their preferred team</li>
<li>Unbearable rough plays/tackles by some of the players</li>
<li>In a game like snow hockey, a player can intentionally hit an opponent with his hockey sticks which can cause violence.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Minimizing Violence</h3>
<p>Violence could be minimized in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stress participation and fair play; not winning at all cost</li>
<li>Officials should be well remunerated to avoid bias</li>
<li>Presence of security officials can help maintain order</li>
<li>Stadiums should not be crowded</li>
<li>A player is a player. Color and tribe are immaterial on the field of play</li>
</ul>
<h3>Marginalization of Blacks and Other Minority Groups by the West</h3>
<p>It was a huge challenge for physical and health education in those days of racism. Blacks and other minority groups were discriminated against. Today, because of the programs of physical and health education and sports, those challenges have been overcome. Incidentally, the blacks that were discriminated against now rule the world of sports.</p>

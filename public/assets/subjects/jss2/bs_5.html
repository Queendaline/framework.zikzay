5&&&Chapter &&&Thermal Energy&&&
<h2>TOPIC 5: THERMAL ENERGY</h2>
<p>Heat is defined as the transfer of energy from one place to another due to temperature change between them. When two objects or bodies are in contact, heat will flow from the hotter object to the cooler object until they attain the same temperature. Sources of heat energy include the sun and burning of fuels</p>
<h3>Heat and Temperature</h3>
<p>Heat is the energy transferred from place to place owing to difference in temperature between them while temperature is a property of heat that decides which way heat will flow when placed in contact with another object. Simply, temperature is the degree of hotness or coldness of a body.</p>

<h4>Methods of Heat Transfer</h4>
<p>Heat is transferred from regions of high temperature to regions of lower temperature by conduction, convection and radiation.</p>
<p>Conduction: This involves the movement of heat energy from particles of the hotter body to those of the colder body when placed in contact without the actual movement of the individual particles. Heat transfer by conduction requires a solid material medium. Heat transfer by conduction can also take place in liquids and gases but they are very poor conductors.</p>
<h6>Good and Bad conductors of Heat Energy</h6>
<p>Conductors allow heat energy to pass through them. Generally, metals are good conductors of heat. Non-metals such as wood, cotton, plastic, rubber, etc. do not allow heat to pass through them and are said to be poor conductors or insulators.</p>
<p>Convection: This is the method of heat transfer in which liquid molecules acquire heat energy and get energized to move in order to transfer heat to the colder molecules. Heat transfer by convection occurs in liquids and gases. The applications of convection current are in the ventilation of a room and in land and sea breezes near the riverine areas.</p>
<p>Radiation: Heat energy is transferred from place to place through empty space in the form of waves. Radiation does not require any material medium for heat transfer. An example of heat transfer by radiation is the heat from the sun that reaches the earth by radiation.</p>
<h4>Absorption of Heat Energy</h4>
<p>When heat Energy falls on any object, it may be reflected, absorbed or allowed to pass through it. While polished surfaces do not absorb much radiant energy, dull or black surfaces absorb it.</p>

<h4>Properties of Heat Energy</h4>
<ul>
<li>It flows from one object to another due to change in temperature</li>
<li>Heat is transferred from the hotter to the colder bodies through the three modes of heat transfer</li>
<li>Heat rays can be refracted (bent) as they move from one medium to another</li>
<li>When heat rays fall on any surface they may also be reflected, absorbed or transmitted (pass through the surface).</li>
</ul>
<h4>Effects of Heat on Matter</h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>Expansion of the body:</strong> It refers to an increase in the size of substances as a result of change in temperature. When substances are heated, they usually expand. However, when they are cooled, they shrink (contract). The rate of expansion is greatest in gases followed by liquids and then least in solids.</li>
<li><strong>Change of state of the body:</strong> When sufficient heat is supplied to a substance, it may lead to change of its physical state like melting from solid to liquid or vaporization from liquid to gas</li>
<li><strong>Change in temperature of the body:</strong> When the body is heated, there Is usually an increase in the temperature of the body</li>
<li><strong>Change in pressure of the body:</strong> When heat is added or supplied to a gas, the pressure of the gas increases also</li>
<li><strong>Chemical changes:</strong> When heat is supplied to a body, it may bring about changes in the chemical properties of a body</li>
<li><strong>Thermionic Emission:</strong> When heat is supplied to metal, it may result to emission of electrons from the surface of the metal.</li>

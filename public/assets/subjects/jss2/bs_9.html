<h2>TOPIC 9: MATERIALS AND THEIR COMMON USES</h2>
<p>Materials commonly used in technology include wood, metals, ceramics, plastics and rubber. We will be focusing our attention on the uses of these technological materials.</p>
<h3>Wood: Uses of Wood</h3>
<p>Wood is used today in the following industries and processes.</p>
<ul>
<li>Furniture: The furniture found in our homes such as beds, cupboards, tables, chairs, wardrobes and so on are made of wood</li>
<li>Building Construction Industry: In building industry, the door frames, doors, windows, wall plates, stair cases, beams, roofing rafters and so on require the use of wood</li>
<li>Education: Exercise books, textbooks, magazines, pencils and so on are items made of wood</li>
<li>Tool Making: The handles of mallets, hammers, screw drivers, chisels, files, shovels, spades, axes machetes and so on are made of wood</li>
<li>Bridges and Poles: Most farm bridges in rural areas, electric poles, railway sleepers and so on are made of wood</li>
<li>Transport: The lorry bodies, railway coaches and wagons are made of wood</li>
<li>Clothing: Some soles of shoes and most heels of shoes are made of wood</li>
<li>Packaging: Items used for packaging products are made of wood</li>
</ul>
<h4>Reasons for Widespread Use of Wood</h4>
<p>The following reasons account for the widespread use of wood for numerous purposes.</p>
<ul>
<li>Wood is easily obtained</li>
<li>Unfinished wood (lumber) is comparatively cheap</li>
<li>Wood is easily worked with tools</li>
<li>When compared to other materials of wide availability, wood possesses considerable strength for its relatively low weight</li>
<li>Wood possesses good acoustic properties. Thus, it is widely employed in the manufacture of musical instruments</li>
<li>Weather and climatic changes do not seriously affect wood that has been properly finished</li>
<li>Wood can absorb fire retardants. This makes wood so treated to be fire-resistant and hence renders it more useful in engineering</li>
<li>Wood is an excellent non-conductor of heat. Therefore, it is widely employed in wall paneling to make the interior of dwelling cool in hot weather and warm in cold weather</li>
<li>Wood does not quickly deteriorate in value if properly handled and protected</li>

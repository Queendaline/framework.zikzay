<h2>TOPIC 10: TOOLS, MACHINES AND PROCESSES</h2>
<p>There are occasions when the movement in one part of a machine would be needed to cause another movement. This movement may be linear or rotary movement.</p>
<h4>Belt and Chain Drives</h4>
<p>Belt and chain drives are used for transmitting power and motion. They are used when drive shafts are separated by a large belt and are used in conjunction with pulleys. There is a motor which rotates when it is powered by electricity or gasoline. Therefore transmitting the movement in one part of a machine using a belt or a chain is what is called a bolt and a chain drive.</p>
<p>Examples of machines that use chain drives are sewing machines, pepper and melon grinders (where the belt is between the motor and the main shaft), recorder player, turn table, and the cooling systems (i.e. radiators and air conditioners) or many motor cars. It is not always necessary in all these cases to have slip-free motion of the belt.</p>
<p>The chain drives on the other hand is used when it is necessary to maintain a constant rotation. Common examples of chain drives are found in the bicycles, motorcycles and other motor cars. Many textile and printing machines also use chain drives.</p>
<h3>Applications of Belt and Chain Drives</h3>
<p>Belt drives found useful applications in the following machines: grinding machine, pepper grinder, sewing machines, melon grinders, recorder player, and turn table and so on. While bicycles, motorcycles, motor cars employ chain drives to monitor constant rotation. Many textile and printing machines also use chain drives.</p>

<h3>Wood Work Machines</h3>
<h4>Types and uses</h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>Portable Power Tools</strong></li>
<li><strong>Belt Sander:</strong> It is one of the portable sanding machines with an endless belt of cloth backed abrasive which passes over two drums. One of the drum is driven by an electric motor while the other one can be adjusted to ensure an easy rotation of the belt. It is used for smoothing hollow shaped surfaces and edges.</li>
<li><strong>Hand Drill:</strong> Portable electric drill plays an important role in wood workshop as far as portable power tools are concerned. It is used for various forms of drilling.</li>
<li><strong>Fret Saw: </strong>It has fine blade like the coping saw but it has a longer rectangular steel frame. It is used for cutting curves in a very light or soft wood. Its long frame is an advantage because it can cut from a long distance.</li>
<li><strong>Machines</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Wood work machines were first made with manual operation and developed to steam and gas to electric motor thus making the machine independent of others. These machines can be used to prepare projects quickly and accurately. Such machines include:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Circular Saw:</strong> This consists of the table, fence, crown guard, saw blade, riving knife, stand, rise and fall, wheel adjustment and the start and stop button. Its primary use is for ripping and deep cutting</li>
<li><strong>Band Saw:</strong> A band saw is the machine counterpart of the fret, coping and bow saws. It is so called because its cutting blade is a narrow strip of metal looped to form a band. The blade is serrated on one side. Basically, it consists of a head supported above a base by means of an upright column. The top of the base supports a flat steel work plate on which the job is placed. The base houses an electric motor, a gear train and a pulley used to cut curves in wood.</li>
<li><strong>Wood Lathe:</strong> A wood lathe is a workshop machine that is employed whenever a job needs to be continuously and rapidly turned while being worked. It is this machine that is used to produce round shaped bowls, round legged poles and other such wooden products. It consists of several parts with the principal ones being the head stock, tail stock and tool rest, bed locking handles, frames and control buttons.</li>
<li><strong>Surface Planer:</strong> A surface Planer shaves the surface of a wooden piece. It is the machine counterpart of hand planes. Depending on the skill of the user, a surface planer can plane accurately and smoothly such that a wood finish can be directly applied on the surface without having to work the surface any further. It consists basically of a base on which is supported a flat, steel work plate. The base houses an electric motor, a gear arrangement and a rotating cylindrical disk. The disk has one or more straight cutting edges somewhere on its curved surface. It is so positioned such that when it rotates, the cutting edges cut through a slot in the steel work plate.</li>
<li><strong>Thicknesser:</strong> A thicknesser is used for planning a wooden piece to a precise thickness. It planes much more finely than a surface planer. Usually, after a surface planer has been used, the job is transferred to a thicknesser so as to plane to precise dimensions. A thicknesser is not much different from a surface planer, being comprised of a base in which is housed an electric motor and gear arrangement, steel work plate which serves as a table and ahead having pressure bars. It has feed rollers which move the wood to the cutters. There are also exit rollers which pass the wood out of the machine. There are two buttons for starting or stopping the operations of the machine. Unlike a surface planer, the top of a thicknesser is not exposed. Wood has to be passed in from underneath.</li>

<li>Carefully obey instructions specifically governing the operation of individual machines</li>
<li>Do not stay too close to machine and neither bring your hand near the cutting tool of the machine</li>
<li>Do not attempt to operate a machine if you do not know how or are not sure of the way to operate it</li>
<li>Wood work machines must be cleaned and lubricated after use</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Hydraulic and Pneumatic Machines</h4>
<p>Hydraulic and pneumatic machines use similar principles to operate, i.e. the ability of water and air to expand immensely when it is subjected to pressure. For example, when you turn on a tap, water gushes out by the pressure pushing the water from the tank. This principle is also applicable to air which cause a pneumatic action in machine.</p>
<p>Examples of hydraulic machines or devices are hydraulic action, hydraulic ram, garden sprinkler and water wheel. Examples of machines that employ pneumatic principle embrace the following: Single force pump, bicycle pump, car foot pump and centrifugal pump in washing machine.</p>
<h5>Principle behind the Working of Hydraulic and Pneumatic Machines or Devices</h5>
<p>The actual basis of hydraulic action or pneumatic devices is explained by Pascal&rsquo;s law which states that &ldquo;any change of pressure applied to the surface of a confined fluid or gas is transmitted unchanged to all parts of the liquid gas&rdquo;. If piston Q has an area of 4cm<sup>2</sup> and a force of 4N exerted on that piston, the pressure is 1ps. This pressure is then transmitted through the pipe T to Piston O. If the piston O has an area of 40cm<sup>2</sup> then the area is 10 times greater and the force exerted by the air inside the piston O is therefore 10 times as great. The pneumatic machine uses the principle to carry a heavy load.</p>
<h5>Uses of Hydraulic Devices</h5>
<ul>
<li>Hydraulic jack is used to lift a car up in order to change its tyre</li>
<li>Single force pump is used to push water, oil, gasoline and air from one pump of a pipe to another</li>
<li>Submersible pump is used to pump water from a well to an overhead tank</li>
<li>Hydraulic ram is used to lift a car to a height convenient for an expert to work under the car</li>
</ul>
<h5>Uses of Pneumatic Devices</h5>
<ul>
<li>Bicycle pump is used to pump air into the tyre of a bicycle</li>
<li>Centrifuge pump is used to extract water from a working machine</li>
<li>Simple force pump is used to blow air into a bat balloon.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Gears</h4>
<p>A gear is a toothed wheel which can be used to transmit motion (power). Gearing is the process of using one gear to drive another. Gears use the advantage of friction to transmit motion since a rough surface has to move over another rough surface. Therefore a gear wheel is a wheel with a number of specially shaped projection or serration teeth along its perimeter. Those teeth mesh with corresponding teeth or another wheel to transmit power or motion. Note that the teeth are placed in such a way that they mesh with one another. If we attempt to rotate one of the meshes using the teeth, the other will rotate in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>Gears are used in a varied number of machines and devices and come in various sizes. Mechanical watches, motor vehicle engines, fans, workshop tools and equipment, ships as well as several other devices which involve speed alteration makes use of gears. The most widely used materials for making gears are metals.</p>
<h5>Types of Gear</h5>
<p>Different situations encountered in the course of transmitting power and motion has given rise to distinct types of gears.</p>
<ul>
<li>Spur Gears: Simple meshing gears having straight teeth and parallel shafts are called spur gears.</li>
<li>Rack and Pinion Gear: When a single spur gear runs along a flat toothed rack, this arrangement is called a rack and pinion gear.</li>
<li>Bevel Gears: When power is to be transmitted between two shafts meeting at right angles, bevel gears are used. A bevel gear consists of teeth made on a frustum of a cone and inclined at an angle to its axis teeth situated on the inside of its rim.</li>
<li>Internal gear: An internal or annular gear has its teeth situated on the inside of its rim.</li>
<li>Planetary gear: A special arrangement of gears called a planetary gear consists of a number of spur gears in meshing contact with one another and another larger gear having internal teeth. They are widely used in automobiles and transport crafts which use propellers.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Use of Gears</h5>
<ul>
<li>Belt and chain gears are used to transfer motion from part of a machine to another especially heavy parts</li>
<li>Gears are used to transmit drive between two parallel shafts</li>
<li>Gears are used to transfer linear motion to rotary motion</li>
<li>Gears are used for transmitting power/drive between the shafts at angles. These are bevel Gears</li>
<li>Gears are used in selecting speed</li>
<li>Gears are used in changing direction</li>
</ul>
<h5>Determination of Gear Ratio and Speed Rotation</h5>
<p>Gears are widely used in Engineering for the transmission of power and motion. One gear is attached to the motion while the other is attached to the machinery to be driven. If the driving gear has 20 teeth and the driven gear has 40 teeth, the gear ratio is said to be 2:1. This relationship is true for the speed of the gear i.e. if the driving gear is rotating at a speed of 500rev/min, the driven gear will rotate at 250rev/min.</p>
<h5>Functions of Lubricants in Gears</h5>
<p>The main purpose of lubrication is to reduce friction and wear and tear or rubbing surfaces. Where friction is not wanted, it is desirable to reduce its effects to a minimum. This is done by separating solid surfaces out of effective contact with each other. In order to achieve this, a lubricant is introduced between the two surfaces. Oil or grease which offers little resistance to motion is usually employed in a thin layer. This film of oil reduces effective contact of the surfaces and reduces resistance to motion.</p>

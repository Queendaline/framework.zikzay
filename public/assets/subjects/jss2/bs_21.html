<h2>TOPIC 21: BASIC COMPUTER OPERATIONS AND CONCEPT</h2>
<p>Software is organized information in the form of operating systems, utilities, programs and applications that enable computers to work. Software consists of carefully organized instructions and code written by programmers in any of various special computer languages. Software is divided commonly into two main categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>System Software: Controls the basic functions of a computer and comes usually preinstalled with the machine.</li>
<li>Application Software: Handles multitudes of common and specialized tasks a user wants to perform such as accounting, communicating, data processing and word processing.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Types of Software with Examples</h3>
<p>There are three types of software:</p>
<ul>
<li>System Software</li>
<li>Application Software</li>
<li>Utility Software (most of the people include this as a sub-category of application software)</li>
</ul>
<h4>System Software</h4>
<p>System software is a collection of one or more programs used to control and coordinate the hardware and other application software. Generally the system software may perform the following functions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Communicates with hardware devices. Controls and monitors the proper use of various hardware resources like CPU, memory, peripheral devices like monitor, printer and so on.</li>
<li>Supports the execution and development of other application software.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Examples of System Software</h4>
<ul>
<li>Operating system</li>
<li>Programming language translators</li>
<li>Communication software</li>
<li>Compiler and Interpreters</li>
<li>Command line shell</li>
</ul>
<h3>Application Software</h3>
<p>Application software is a collection of one or more programs used to solve a specific task. Generally software used in banking industry, airline/railway reservation, generation of telephone or electricity bills and so on all fall under application software.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Examples of Application Software</h4>
<ul>
<li>Word processing software i.e. Microsoft word, word pad, etc.</li>
<li>Spreadsheet software i.e. Microsoft Excel</li>
<li>Database software i.e. Microsoft Access</li>
<li>Education software</li>
<li>Entertainment software</li>
</ul>
<h3>Utility Software</h3>
<p>Utility software is a collection of one or more programs that helps the user in system maintenance tasks and in performing tasks of routine nature. Utility programs help the users in disk formatting, data compression, data backup, scanning for viruses etc.</p>
<h4>Examples of Utility Software</h4>
<ul>
<li>Anti-virus</li>
<li>Registry cleaners</li>
<li>Disk defragmenters</li>
<li>Data backup utility</li>
<li>Disk cleaners</li>
</ul>

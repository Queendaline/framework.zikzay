20&&&Chapter &&&Non-Communicable Diseasees and Their Prevention&&&
<h2>TOPIC 20: NON-COMMUNICABLE DISEASES AND THEIR PREVENTION</h2>
<p>Non-communicable diseases are diseases that one cannot contract by having contact with an infected person. The carrier cannot pass them to a healthy person. They are not contagious and cannot be passed from person to person. People of all ages are vulnerable to these diseases as long as they are exposed to those factors that cause them.</p>
<p>Because of the socioeconomic impacts of non-communicable diseases on families and the society, it is important to control or if possible prevent the spread. There are quite a number of non-communicable diseases including those caused by food nutrient deficiency such as rickets, beriberi, kwashiorkor, goiter, etc. However, there are others that are not connected with food nutrient deficiency such as obesity, asthma, anemia, sickle cell, cancer, heart disease, etc.</p>
<h3>Sickle Cell Disease</h3>
<p>Sickle cell is a hereditary disease (passed from parent to child before the child is born). It is caused by the production of abnormal types of red blood cells which have sickle shape instead of the normal round shape of cells. The disadvantage of this sickle or crescent shaped red blood cells is that because of their shape they do not pass through the small blood vessels easily and may at times block the blood supply to vital organs of the body such as the brain, kidney, heart, and so on. If there is blockage in the coronary artery, that is, the artery that supplies blood to the walls of the heart, heart attack may result.</p>
<p>The sickle shaped red blood cells also have reduced hemoglobin content thereby reducing oxygen content of the cell which affects the quantity of energy liberated in the body. This accounts for the tiredness experienced by sickle cell patients most of the time. The disease is not contagious.</p>
<h4>Symptoms of Sickle Cell Disease</h4>
<ul>
<li>Abdominal pain</li>
<li>Severe leg cramp</li>
<li>Yellowish discoloration of the eyes</li>
<li>Pain in the bone</li>
<li>Feverish condition</li>
<li>Anemia</li>
<li>In severe case, chronic ulcer of the leg may occur</li>
</ul>
<h4>Prevention/Control</h4>
<p>The only way to prevent this disease is by discouraging people who are carriers from marrying themselves. However, if it is ascertained that a person has sickle cell disease, it is advisable to follow the under listed instructions to reduce incessant crisis.</p>
<ul>
<li>Eating highly nutritious food particularly those rich in protein</li>
<li>Avoid strenuous exercises such as sprinting, climbing, playing football</li>
<li>Take patient to the doctor when there is crisis</li>
<li>Blood transfusion is necessary.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Obesity</h3>
<p>Obesity can be defined as excessive body fats in the body. This is largely due to over eating. Obesity is one of the major health problems of this age because of the nature of the food that is consumed. Presently, in our markets and food stores, there are many appetizing foodstuffs with high fat content. Adults and young people alike eat them even in-between meals regardless of their fat content. Continuous voracious intake of this type of food stuffs without corresponding exercises or coupled with a lot of inactivity may result to obesity. The danger of this disease is that the victim stands the risk of developing diabetes, heart diseases and other complications.</p>
<h4>Prevention</h4>
<p>The following can prevent obesity in both old and young people. They include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Well regulated exercises</li>
<li>Avoid eating in-between meals</li>
<li>Avoid eating fatty foods</li>
<li>Consumption of lean meat, vegetables and fruits is encouraged</li>
<li>Overeating should be avoided</li>
<li>Sedentary jobs without exercise can result to obesity so exercises are very important for sedentary workers</li>
</ul>
<h3>Asthma (Bronchial Asthma)</h3>
<p>Asthma is one of the respiratory diseases characterized by narrowing of the air passages such as the trachea, bronchi, and so on. This disease causes an interference with the passage of air through the branches. This interference is largely due to congestion brought about by mucus. The result of this congestion is difficulty in expelling air than drawing in air. In an asthmatic patient, the bronchi and the bronchiole become swollen and congested with mucus.</p>
<h4>Causes</h4>
<p>Bronchiole asthma is caused by some allergens such as dusty atmosphere, smoke, and pollen grains from flowers and crops; others include animal hairs such as dogs, goats, cats, some chemicals, emotional stress, worry, cold temperature, nitrogen oxide, high humidity and so on. When a person with asthma inhales an allergen which that person is sensitive to, the bronchi and the bronchiole constrict triggering off a type of reaction resulting in difficulty in breathing. This is clinically referred to as asthmatic attack. Asthma limits the social life of its patient because people with asthma are afraid of going to places where they may be exposed to an allergen they are sensitive to.</p>
<p>Symptoms of asthma are coughing, wheezing, short breath, chest tightness, noisy breathe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Prevention/Control</h4>
<p>Asthma attacks can be prevented or minimized in several ways which include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoidance of allergens such as dust, paints, pollen grains from flowers and crops, hair from dogs, goats, worries, emotional stress.</li>
<li>Adhering strictly to the doctor&rsquo;s instruction on medication which include having one&rsquo;s inhaler always in one&rsquo;s pocket.</li>
<li>Pregnant women to abstain from smoking</li>
<li>Unnecessary exposure to cold and high humidity should be avoided</li>
<li>Pets such as cats and dogs should be kept away from asthma patients</li>
<li>Emotional stress and worry should be reduced</li>
<li>Annual immunization with influenza vaccine may be of help</li>
<li>Physical exercises may be of help, however, care must be taken to avoid further problems.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Anemia</h3>
<p>The term anemia is a condition that occurs when blood is deficient of healthy red blood cells or hemoglobin. Sometimes, when the number of red blood cells in a specified quantity of blood is below normal, anemia is suspected. Normal blood contains 40-45 percent red blood cells and 55-60 percent plasma. A man&rsquo;s blood normally contains more hemoglobin than that of a woman. 100ml of blood of a normal man contains 14-16 grams of hemoglobin while that of a woman contains 12-14 grams. Any adult having less than 12 grams of hemoglobin per 100ml of blood may be considered anemic.</p>
<p>Hemoglobin is a very important part of red blood cells. It can be divided into two &ndash; &lsquo;hemo&rsquo; and &lsquo;globin&rsquo;. &lsquo;Hemo&rsquo; has to do with iron molecules which have a strong affinity for oxygen which it sends to other parts of the body for the liberation of energy. &lsquo;Globin&rsquo; has to do with protein for body building and replacement of worn out tissues.</p>
<h4>Causes of Anemia</h4>
<ul>
<li>Faulty red blood cell production. This is as a result of lack of some minerals and vitamins necessary for the production of healthy red blood cells</li>
<li>Loss of blood. In this case, red blood cells can be lost by gastro-intestinal conditions such as cancer, ulcer, and so on as well as internal bleeding (hemorrhage). Blood could also be lost by women during child birth or during their menstrual period.</li>
<li>Destruction of red blood cell. This is prevalent when red blood cells assume a sickle shape due to sickle cell disease. The body destroys these sickle shaped red cells because they are unable to pass through small blood vessels (arteries). Because of the destruction of these red cells, the body is denied red cells resulting in anemia.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Symptoms</h4>
<p>Some of the common symptoms and signs of anemia include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The person is easily fatigued or fagged out</li>
<li>He or she experiences shortness of breath when involved in any physical activity</li>
<li>The heart beat is usually irregular</li>
<li>Headache</li>
<li>In extreme cases, deformed fingernails are seen.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Prevention and Control</h4>
<p>Anemia could be prevented if the under listed instructions are followed judiciously.</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid prolonged sickness. See the doctor as soon as you take ill.</li>
<li>Eat food rich in vitamins and minerals to ensure the production of healthy red blood cells</li>
<li>Pregnant mothers should visit good hospitals to avoid much loss of blood during child birth</li>
<li>Women whose menstrual flow is in excess should seek medical help.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Kwashiorkor</h3>
<p>Kwashiorkor is a protein deficiency disease prevalent among the poor and low income group. Children are more vulnerable to this disease than adults because children&rsquo;s source of protein after weaning is not available due to poverty and sometimes ignorance.</p>
<h4>Causes of Kwashiorkor</h4>
<p>The major cause of Kwashiorkor is when protein nutrient is deficient in the body, that is, when the child is not fed with protein rich foods such as milk, meat, soya beans, fish, vegetables, egg, and beans.</p>
<h4>Symptoms</h4>
<p>Kwashiorkor presents the following symptoms:</p>
<ul>
<li>The child looks puffy and bloated due to retention of water in the body</li>
<li>He is usually weak and unable to participate in physical activities with other children</li>
<li>The luxuriant black hairs become discolored, that is it changes from black to brown</li>
<li>When it is fully developed, the child develops protruding abdomen and thin legs</li>
<li>Growth is stunted because body building nutrient, protein is not available</li>
<li>There may be frequent watery stooling</li>
</ul>
<h4>Prevention</h4>
<p>Since kwashiorkor is a dietary deficient disease, it can be prevented by eating protein rich diet. Such protein rich foods include milk, meat, soya beans and fish. A technical way of preventing the disease is by advising poor parents to have limited number of children so that they can take care of them conveniently.</p>

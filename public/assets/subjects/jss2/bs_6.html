<h2>TOPIC 6: CRUDE OIL AND PETRO-CHEMICALS</h2>
<h3>Meaning of Crude Oil</h3>
<p>Crude Oil can also be called petroleum. It is a dark sticky viscous liquid which is found in underground deposits in some parts of the world. Crude oil is a complex mixture of hydrocarbons. A hydrocarbon is a compound containing carbon and hydrogen only. Natural gas which is equally a mixture of hydrocarbons is usually found together with crude oil. Petroleum is composed of gaseous, liquid and solid hydrocarbons (alkanes, alkenes, cycloalkanes, aromatic hydrocarbons) and other compounds. These are also called petrochemicals because they are products obtained from petroleum.</p>
<h3>Origin of Crude Oil and Natural Gas</h3>
<p>Crude oil and natural gas are formed from the remains of dead marine algae (plants) and animals once living in the sea. They are known as fossil fuels. These plants and animals were buried under the sea bed millions of years ago. Through the activity of bacteria, heat and pressure, these plant and animal remains changed gradually into crude oil and natural gas. The oil and gas formed slowly moved to other areas through tiny holes or pores in the porous rocks and around them. Since oil and gas are not dense, they tend to seep upwards until they meet a non-porous layer of rocks which trap them underneath to form an oil trap.</p>
<h3>Oil Exploration and Drilling</h3>
<p>The search for crude oil is known as exploration. This can be done through aerial photography, examining the surface rocks, mapping the earth&rsquo;s layers and drilling. This begins with geologists. When they identify the types of rock found near oil-bearing areas through mapping, they now work as a team involving other scientists and engineers and drilling begins. Drilling is the process of extracting crude oil from oil traps with pipes. Some of the area of oil location could be on land but many are found deep inside the sea.</p>
<p>Crude oil is extracted by drilling deep holes or wells into the ground using rotary rig which drives down strong pipes to reach the oil trap. &nbsp;Natural gas comes out first under pressure. It is similar to how water is pumped out of borehole but more complicated. Later, the oil comes up as it is being pumped out. The oil is then stored in large steel tanks in oil fields until it is sent to oil refineries for purification through pipelines or tankers. The color of the oil varies from amber to greenish brown and to black. The color depends on the area of the location.</p>
<h3>Nigeria&rsquo;s Crude Oil Reserves</h3>
<p>This was first discovered at Olobini in 1956 in the Niger Delta Region. On land, there are large oil fields in Niger Delta, Afam, Abata, Bonny, Owaza, Egbema, Ugheli, Kokori, Oleh and Bomu. Oil also occurs offshore at Calabar and in the Burutu zone of Delta State. Today, crude oil deposits have been found in coastal areas of Rivers, Akwa-Ibom, Imo and Abia States. Nigeria is one of the leading oil producing countries in the world and an important member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). Oil refineries in Nigeria are located in Port Harcourt, Emene, Warri and Kaduna.</p>
<h3>Refining of Crude Oil &ndash; Fractional Distillation</h3>
<p>Crude oil is a mixture of several hydrocarbons. Refining means the preparation of useful products from crude oil. The process of refining is to separate the oil mixture into different components called fractions. Crude oil is also referred to as black gold because of its high value when it is refined. The oil is first of all cleaned up in the field after drilling to remove certain impurities like water, gas, sulphur and nitrogen-containing substances before sending it to the refineries through a network of pipelines.</p>
<h3>Products of Refined Oil and Their Uses</h3>
<h4>Natural Gas</h4>
<p>Natural gas is usually found together with crude oil. It consists of gaseous hydrocarbons, mainly methane although having other components like propane and butane which can be readily liquefied under pressure and stored as Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG). This is stored in steel cylinders and used as domestic and industrial cooking gas. Natural gas is colorless, odorless and tasteless and as a result hydrogen sulphide is added to it to enable its users smell it whenever there is a leakage and at the same time serve as a safety measure to avoid fire accident.</p>
<h5>Uses of Natural Gas</h5>
<ul>
<li>LNG is used for domestic and industrial cooking and heating purposes</li>
<li>It is used as a raw material for paints, plastics, fertilizers, photographic films and explosives</li>
<li>It is used as fuel for heavy-duty vehicles and engines</li>
<li>It is used to power stations for electricity generation</li>
<li>Some industries use it to produce steel, gas, paper clothing and so on.</li>
<li>It could also be used to operate furnaces, water heaters, cloth driers and other household appliances</li>
</ul>
<h4>Petrochemicals</h4>
<p>Petrochemicals are chemical products derived from petroleum and natural gas. They can be obtained in two ways. In the first instance, they may be present in raw crude oil and then extracted during the process of fractional distillation of crude oil. They are then treated to produce organic chemicals that could be used as raw materials for other products. Examples include methane, ethane and propene as gaseous hydrocarbons. However, they may be synthesized during crude oil refining process.</p>
<h5>Uses of Petrochemicals</h5>
<ul>
<li>They are used in making synthetic rubbers for tyres, footwear and plastics</li>
<li>They are used for making synthetic fibres like nylon ropes, threads and clothes</li>
<li>They are used as raw materials for making drugs and cosmetics and so on</li>
<li>They are also useful in making agro-chemicals such as fertilizers, pesticides, insecticides, herbicides, fungicides and so on</li>
<li>An important petrochemical use is in the manufacture of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) polyethene bags as well as irrigation pipes</li>
<li>Other petrochemicals are also used in the manufacture of paints, dyes, detergents, solvents and so on</li>
<li>Some of the petrochemicals are used in the school laboratory for science practical. Examples include ethanol propanone, benzene, phenol, and toluene.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Importance of Crude Oil to Nigeria</h3>
<ul>
<li>Crude Oil is a great foreign exchange earner. The economy of Nigeria is almost totally dependent on crude oil. Oil is responsible for more than 95% of the country&rsquo;s foreign exchange earnings. The money earned from oil is used to finance other developmental projects in the country</li>
<li>Crude oil exploration and refining provides employment opportunities to many skilled and unskilled Nigerians</li>
<li>Petroleum and natural gas are used for generating electricity which is widely used in homes, offices and industries</li>
<li>Petroleum products are used extensively as the greatest sources of chemical energy in homes, offices and industries</li>
<li>Petroleum products and natural gas serve as raw materials for various petrochemical industries.</li>

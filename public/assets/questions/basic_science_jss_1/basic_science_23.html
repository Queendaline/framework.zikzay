A process whereby a material known as solder is melted between two metallic surfaces so as to join them together is referred as? &&& Brazing &&& soldering &&& welding &&& riveting &&&b
Solder has a lower melting point than the metal to be joined. &&& True &&& false &&& both &&& nearly true &&&a
There three types of soldering. &&& True &&& false &&& both &&& nearly true &&&b
Joints produced through hard soldering are much stronger than those produced through soft soldering. &&& True &&& false &&& both &&& nearly true &&&a
Most hard solders are alloys of mainly silver, with copper and zinc. &&& True &&& false &&& both &&& nearly true &&&a
Hard solders are largely alloys of tin and lead. &&& True &&& false &&& both &&& nearly true &&&b
Ferrous metals such as steels and irons are easily soldered. &&& True &&& false &&& both &&& nearly true &&&b
A joining that takes place at temperature higher than 425°C &&& Brazing &&& soldering &&& welding &&& riveting &&&a
A distinct metal joining process is known as? &&& Brazing &&& soldering &&& welding &&& riveting &&&a
The melting of a nonferrous filler metal at the point of contact of two metallic surfaces in order to join them is known as? &&& Brazing &&& soldering &&& welding &&& riveting &&&a
We have ______ types of brazing? &&& 2 &&& 3 &&& 4 &&& 5 &&&b
Copper brazing is done at a temperature range of ______? &&& 63°C - 84°C &&& 109°C - 1150°C &&& 57°C - 64°C &&& 109°C- 140°C &&&b
Silver brazing is done at a temperature range of ______? &&& 63°C - 84°C &&& 109°C - 1150°C &&& 57°C - 64°C &&& 109°C- 140°C &&&a
Aluminum brazing is done at a temperature. &&& 63°C - 84°C &&& 109°C - 1150°C &&& 57°C - 64°C &&& 109°C- 140°C &&&c
There are_______essential soldering tools. &&& 3 &&& 2 &&& 4 &&& 5 &&&a
The soldering iron operates on the principle of ______? &&& Energy &&& Joule heat &&& power &&& conductivity &&&b
Brazing tools include the following except? &&& Filter &&& heat source &&& flux &&& solder &&&d
The following are devices through which heat can be supplied for the purpose of brazing except? &&& Gas torch &&& electric heater &&& furnace &&& electric iron &&&d
Soldering is the same as brazing. &&& True &&& false &&& both &&& nearly true &&&b
In brazing, the filler metal melts, wets the surfaces and fills the tiny gap. &&& True &&& false &&& both &&& nearly true &&&a
The flux prevents oxidation on the surfaces to be joined and also makes the filler metal to flow more readily when it is melted. &&& True &&& false &&& both &&& nearly true &&&a
The filler metal ought to be coated with a brazing flex. &&& True &&& false &&& both &&& nearly true &&&b
Zinc chloride and ammonium chloride fluxes are common. &&& True &&& false &&& both &&& nearly true &&&a
Flux does not dissolve oxides present on the surfaces being joined. &&& True &&& false &&& both &&& nearly true &&&b
For soldering electrical connections and electronic circuits, a non-corrosive flux, for example, rosin is used. &&& True &&& false &&& both &&& nearly true &&&a
Devices used for producing heat needed for soldering include the following except? &&& Soldering iron &&& flame heater &&& the gas torch &&& filter &&&d
Brazing is particularly useful in joining dissimilar metals. &&& True &&& false &&& both &&& nearly true &&&a
Brazing takes place at a temperature higher than 425Â°C. &&& True &&& false &&& both &&& nearly true &&&a
Gold is a good ferrous metal. &&& True &&& false &&& both &&& nearly true &&&b
Silver is one the most useful ferrous metal. &&& True &&& false &&& both &&& nearly true &&&b

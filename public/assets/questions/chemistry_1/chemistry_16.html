Corrosion in metals is an example of &&& electrochemical process. &&& half-cell reaction. &&& metal-plating device &&& metal coupling device &&&c
 Flow of current in electrolytes is due to the movement of &&& electrons. &&& ho les and electrons. &&& ions. &&& charges. &&&c What are products of the electrolysis of concentrated calcium chloride solution? &&& Cl<sub>2</sub> &&& Ca, O<sub>2</sub> &&& H<sub>2</sub>, Cl<sub>2</sub> &&& Ca, H<sub>2</sub>, Cl<sub>2 </sub>&&&d
 What quantity of electricity is consumed when 10 amperes was consumed in l hour during electrolysis? &&& 36 kilo coulombs &&& 3600 coulombs &&& 7200 coulombs &&& 72 kilo coulombs &&&a
 Calculate the mass of aluminium deposited when a current of 3.0 amperes is passed through an aluminium electrolyte for 2 hours (Al = 27, l Faraday = 96 500 cm) &&& 1.0 g &&& 6.04 g &&& 4.04 g &&& 2.02 g &&&b
 In electrolytic purification processes, the impure metal to be purified is used as &&& anode &&& cathode &&& electrolyte &&& salt bridge. &&&c
 One faraday is equal to &&& 9650 coulombs. &&& 96500 coulombs &&& one mole of electrons &&& two a mole of electrons E. half a mole of electrons. &&&b
 In the electrolysis of brine, the anode must be carbon because carbon is a reducing agent. &&& chlorine does not reduce carbon &&& carbon induces the discharge of chlorine. &&& carbon is very reactive with chlorine E. chlorine attacks other elements but not carbon. &&&b Potential difference set up between metal and its solution is called &&& metal voltage. &&& back e.m.f. &&& electrode potential. &&& electrode potential of the metal. &&&b
 Potential difference set up when a metal is in contact with one molar solution of its ions at 250C is called &&& inert standard potential. &&& standard electrode potential &&& electrochemical cell. &&& Galvanic cell &&&c
 Electrode potential value of pure hydrogen at all temperatures is &&& 1 &&& zero &&& 2 &&& 0.5 &&&d 
These are factors affecting standard electrode potential except &&& pressure &&& overall energy change. &&& the concentration of ions in the solution. &&& temperature. &&&d
 Half-cell electrode of copper system is represented conventionally as &&& Cu<sub>(s)</sub>/Cu<sup>2+</sup><sub>(aq)</sub> &&& Cu<sup>2+</sup><sub>(aq)</sub>/ Cu<sub>(s) </sub>&&& Cu<sup>2+</sup><sub>(aq)</sub>//Cu<sub>(s) </sub>&&& Cu//Cu<sup>2+</sup><sub>(s)</sub>&&&d
 Two half cells which are capable of converting chemical energy to electrical energy is called &&& a cell &&& electrochemical cell &&& chemical potential &&& metallic potential &&&c
 Which of the electrodes does oxidation occur? &&& At the cathode. &&& At the anode. &&& At the electrolyte &&& At the half electrode. &&&a
 The overall redox reactions occurring at the electrodes is represented as (in copperlzinc cell) Cu<sup>2+</sup><sub>(aq)</sub>/Cu<sub>(s)</sub>//Zn(s)/Zn<sup>2+</sup><sub>(aq)</sub>the double represents &&& capacitor &&& battery &&& salt bridge &&& inert conductor. &&&a
 The major function of a salt bridge in cell is to &&& smoothen the electron flow &&& to provide electrolyte &&& to complete the electric circuit &&& to provide adequate driving force&middot; &&&c

<p>Rate of chemical depends on the following factors except &&& Rate at which gas is evolved &&& rate at which products are formed &&& rate at which colour of reactions change &&& rate at which the reactants diminish. &&&a 
<p>The units of rate of chemical reaction is &&& Mol dm<sup>-3</sup> S<sup>-1 </sup>&&& Mol<sup>-1</sup> S<sup>-1</sup> &&& Mol<sup>-1</sup> &&& S Mol<sup>-3</sup> &&&c 
<p>If 2g of zinc granules was reacted with excess dilute HCI to evolve hydrogen gas which came to completion after 5 minutes. Calculate the rate of the chemical reaction in g hr<sup>1</sup> &&& 48 g hr<sup>1</sup> &&& 12 g hr<sup>1</sup> &&& 24 &&& 240 g hr<sup>1</sup> &&&c 
<p>For most irreversible reactions, &&& the reaction rate increases with time. &&& the react ion rate decreases with time. &&& the rate stabilizes with time. &&& the rate produces a curve with time. &&&b 
<p>Minimum or critical amount of energy required before a chemical reaction could occur is called &&& reaction energy &&& effective collision &&& activation energy. &&& activated complex. &&&a Reaction occurs when the colliding reactant particles &&& have energy less than the energy barrier &&& have energy equal or greater than the energy barrier &&& have energy less than effective collision. &&& have energy greater than that of the products. &&&c 
<p>These are factors affecting chemical reaction except &&& surface are&&& &&& catalyst &&& nature of reactants &&& activating energy. &&&c 
<p>What do we do to increase the surface area of the reactants &&& breaking them into chips &&& subjecting the reactants to high pressure. &&& altering the direction of the reaction &&& us in g reactants to different densities &&&b 
<p>In the reaction; N<sub>2(g)</sub> + H<sub>2(g)</sub> $\frac{finely}{iron}~$NH<sub>3(g)</sub> Why was finely divided iron used as catalyst? &&& To increase the forward reaction &&& To reduce the energy barrier &&& To increase the surface area of reactants. &&& None of the above. &&&c 
<p>Temperature affects rate of reaction except &&& it increases the frequency of collision &&& it bums the reactants with reckless heating &&& it increases the kinetic energy of the reactant &&& the number of effective collisions of the reactants. &&&d What factor is responsible for the following reactions: (i) decomposite of H<sub>2</sub>0<sub>2</sub> (ii) reaction between methane and chlorine (iii) conversion of silver halides to grey metallic silver. &&& Decomposition &&& Light &&& Concentrators &&& Catalyst &&&c 
<p>Catalysts &&& increases the equilibrium constants of reactants. &&& brings about the energy barrier of reaction. &&& lowers the activation energy of reaction &&& summonts the energy barrier of reaction. &&&a 
<p>Which of the following factors does not affect the rate of a chemical reaction between non-gaseous reactants? &&& Concentration of reactants &&& Pressure &&& Temperature &&& Presence of a catalyst E. Surface area of contact &&&d  Two identical samples of calcium trioxo&shy;carbonate(IV) are placed in two beakers. 100cm<sup>3</sup> of 1.0 M hydrochloric acid are added to one, and 100 m<sup>3</sup> of 0.5 M hydrochloric acid are added to the other. All other conditions are the same. Which of these is the same for the two cases? &&& Average rate of evolution of gas &&& Mass lost from the beakers on completion of reaction. &&& Time taken for the reaction to complete &&& Initial reaction rate.

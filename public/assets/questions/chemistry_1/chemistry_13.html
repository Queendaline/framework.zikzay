Mendelev periodic table was arranged in order of their &&& atomic numbers &&& molecular shapes and orbitals &&& increasing relative atomic mass &&& orbital configuration. &&&c
 Elements in the same group of the periodic table have &&& similar electronic configuration &&& similar orbital configuration &&& the same number of valence electrons &&& the same number of electrons. &&&c 
S-block elements of the periodic table are made up of &&& groups 1, 2, 3 &&& groups 1 and 2 &&& group 3 &&& groups 3 to 7 &&&b 
Special properties of the transition elements are as a result of &&& ability to produce coloured ions &&& ability to have variable valencies &&& ability to possess partially filled d-orbitals &&& inert octect electrons &&&c 
Which of the following decrease across the period? &&& atomic size &&& electron affinity &&& electronegativity &&& inert tendencies &&&a 
Important properties of elements which show periodicity are &&& melting and boiling points &&& electrical conductivities &&& ionization energies and atomic size. &&& electronegativities. &&&c Ionization energy of an atom is affected by &&& distance of the outermost electron from the nucleus. &&& the size of the positive nuclear charge &&& the screening effect of the inner electrons. &&& solvent medium. &&&d 
The following groups of elements show great similarity in their chemical properties except &&& group 1 &&& group 7 &&& group 0 &&& group 5 &&&d 
Which of the following is insoluble in water? &&& MgO &&& P4O10 &&& K2O &&& N2O3 &&&a 
All these properties belong to the halogens excepts &&& they are all non-metals &&& they exist as diatomic molecules &&& they are coloured &&& they do not ionize to form univalent negative ions. &&&d 
Which of the noble gases has the greatest ionization energy? &&& He &&& Ar &&& Xe &&& Kr &&&c 
Which of these characters does not belong to the first transition elements? &&& Ability to form coloured ions &&& ability to have variable valencies &&& inability to form complex ions &&& ability to be used as catalysts. &&&c 
Which of the actinides is commonly used as a nuclear fuel? &&& Uranium &&& Actinium &&& Thorium &&& Palladium &&&a What is the chemical formula for Tungsten? &&& Ti &&& W &&& Ir &&& Y &&&b 
In the Periodic Table, elements are arranged according to their &&& atomic masses. &&& mass numbers. &&& atomic numbers &&& electronegativities. E. valence electrons. &&&c 
Energy required to remove the most loosely bound electron from a gaseous atom to form the gaseous ion is &&& gaseous energy &&& ionization energy &&& dissociation energy. &&& atomization energy. E. electrical energy. &&&b 
Elements in the same group in the Periodic Table have the same &&& number of valence electrons &&& number of shells. &&& atomic mass &&& atomic number. E. electronic configuration. &&&a

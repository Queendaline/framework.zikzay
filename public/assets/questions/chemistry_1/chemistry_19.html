Two boys balanced steady in a sea saw game is an example of &&& static equilibrium &&& dynamic equilibrium &&& homogenous equilibrium &&& mutual equilibrium &&&b
In most equilibrium reactions, the catalyst is not required because &&& catalyst reduces the energy barrier &&& the reactants could be gases while the products may by solid &&& catalyst favours both forward and backward reactions &&& catalyst could be positive or negative &&&d
All except one is not a condition for considering pressure in an equilibrium system &&& There must be concentration gradient between the reactants and the products &&& The reactants could be gases while the products may be solids &&& Both products and reactants must be gaseous &&& the reaction takes place in a closed system. &&&b
 In the reaction, what effect has conc. H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> on the equilibrium? CH<sub>3</sub>OOH + C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH  Conc. H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4 </sub>CH<sub>3</sub>COOC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O &&& to acidify the system &&& to encourage backward reaction &&& to encourage forward reaction &&& to produce more CH<sub>3</sub>OOH. &&&c
 In the reaction; H<sub>2(g)</sub> + I<sub>2(g)</sub> 2HI<sub>(g)</sub> The effect of pressure on this system is &&& to encourage forward reaction &&& to encourage backward reaction &&& to remove the energy barrier &&& pressure may not have any effect &&&c
 Catalysts are important in chemical industry in that &&& it affects the purity of the products &&& it affects the quantity of the products &&& it increases the time for reacting equilibrium &&& bond breaking is slowed down &&&c &&& Draw &&& Final &&& Sweep &&& Love &&&d

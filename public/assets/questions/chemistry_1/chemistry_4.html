An element belongs to a period in the periodic table because of &&& the number of electrons in its outer-most shell &&& the shell number &&& the electronic configuration in the azimuthal quantum number &&& the size of the atom. &&&b
The major reason why chemical reaction occurs among elements that they have the tendency to &&& attain the nearest noble gas structure &&& become a metal. &&& become a non-metal &&& become any noble element. &&&a
In electrovalency most metallic atoms with few valence electrons give out electrons because &&& they are unstable &&& they require less energy to give away these electrons. &&& they require more energy to give away these electrons &&& they need non-metals to operate. &&&b
In electrovalency, valence electrons are transferred and the atomic number is &&& also reduced &&& stabilized &&& unaffected &&& destabilized &&&c
Arrangement of ions in a regular pattern in a solid crystal is called &&& configuration. &&& atomic structure. &&& lattice. &&& buffer. &&&c
If force is applied to an electrovalent crystal, &&& the shape will be deformed &&& the shape will not be deformed &&& the crystal will not be fractured &&& the shape and the crystal structure will be deformed &&&b

The bond type between copper II ion and water molecules is &&& electrovalent bond &&& covalent bond &&& Dative covalent bond &&& hydrogen bond &&&c
The bond between two iodine molecules is &&& co-ordinate bond &&& electrovalent bond &&& ionic bond &&& van der Waal's forces. &&& d
Bonds between a highly electronegative atom and a hydrogen from another molecule is called &&& hydrogen bond &&& covalent bond &&& inter molecular forces &&& ligand &&&a
Rare gases are stable because they A are monoatomic &&& are volatile gases &&& form ions easily &&& have duplet or octet electronic configurations in the outermost shells of their atoms &&& have no neutrons in their nucleus. &&&d
Which of these is the same in isotopes of an element? &&& Mass number &&& Number of neutrons &&& Number of protons and neutrons &&& Relative atomic mass &&& Atomic number &&&e
Which of these statements is not correct? In going across Period 3 (from sodium to argon) of the Periodic Table, we notice that &&& the melting point and boiling point increase gradually. &&& the first ionization energy increases &&& the atomic size increases to the middle of the period and then decreases. &&& there is a gradual change in their oxides from basic to acidic (argon does not form an oxide) E. there is a gradual decrease in electro-positivity &&&a
Which element has an electronic configuration of Is<sup>2</sup>s<sup>2</sup>s2<sup>2</sup>p6<sup>3</sup>s<sup>1</sup>? &&& Calcium &&& Chlorine &&& Potassium &&& Sodium E. Nitrogen &&&d
Determine the maximum number of electrons that can occupy the principal energy level N of an atom &&& 18 &&& 24 &&& 24 &&& 32 &&&d
All pure samples of the same chemical compound contain the same elements in the same proportion by mass is a statement of &&& law of conservation of matter. &&& the law of constant composition. &&& the law of multiple proportion. &&& Gay Lussac’s law &&&a
Stoichiometry is based on the law of &&& multiple proportion. &&& constant composition. &&& conservation of energy &&& conservation of mass &&&d
A balance chemical equation is based on the law of &&& periodicity &&& constant composition &&& multiple proportion &&& conservation of mass &&&d
The number of particles in one mole of a chemical compound is the &&& atomic number &&& Avogadro’s number &&& mass number &&& oxidation number  &&&b

From the reaction 2H<sub>2</sub>O(I) _______ 2H<sub>2</sub>(g) + O<sub>2</sub>g     H = 285.58 Kj mol-1  it means that &&& 285.58 kilojoules of energy was absorbed from the surrounding &&& 285.58 kilojoules of energy was released into the surrounding &&& 285.58 is the entropy change of the reaction &&& none of the above &&&b
Endothermic reaction may be defined as except &&& reaction in which heat is absorbed &&& reaction in which heat is released &&& reaction in which  H= positive. &&& reaction in which the energy of the product is higher than energy of the reactant. &&&c
The notation M-I,8 represents &&& enthalpy change of formation. &&& heat change of formation. &&& standard heat change of formation. &&& standard enthalpy of formation. &&&b
Precaution taken when measuring heat of combustion of a specimen are except &&& the use of well lagged calorimeter &&& use of volumes of water but continuously stirred &&& Both water and the bomb must attain steady temperature before igniting the bomb &&& temperatures of the ignited bomb is taken every 30  second interval until a steady temperature is attained &&&a
The energy spent on disorganizing the regular structure of ions in a molecule is called &&& conformation energy &&& lattice energy &&& ionization energy &&& electron affinity &&&c
Substances which dissolve endothermically would dissolve more at &&& lower temperature. &&& any temperature provided not below freezing point. &&& higher temperature. &&& any isolated temperature. &&&b

Distilled water is different from deionized water because &&& distilled water is a product of condensed steam while deionized water is filtered laboratory water &&& dis tilled water is always pure and sold in packs while deionized water is not packaged for consumption &&& distilled water is a condensed steam but deionized water is produced using exchange resins which absorb undesired ions &&& distilled water is man-made while deionized water is both natural and artificial. &&&c
